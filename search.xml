<hr>
<p>The scene is one many of us have somewhere in our family history: Dozens of people celebrating Thanksgiving or some other holiday around a makeshift stretch of family tables—siblings, cousins, aunts, uncles, great-aunts. The grandparents are telling the old family stories for the 37th time. “It was the most beautiful place you’ve ever seen in your life,” says one, remembering his first day in America. “There were lights everywhere … It was a celebration of light! I thought they were for me.”</p>
<p>The oldsters start squabbling about whose memory is better. “It was cold that day,” one says about some faraway memory. “What are you talking about? It was May, late May,” says another. The young children sit wide-eyed, absorbing family lore and trying to piece together the plotline of the generations.</p>
<p>After the meal, there are piles of plates in the sink, squads of children conspiring mischievously in the basement. Groups of young parents huddle in a hallway, making plans. The old men nap on couches, waiting for dessert. It’s the extended family in all its tangled, loving, exhausting glory.</p>
<p>This particular family is the one depicted in Barry Levinson’s 1990 film, Avalon, based on his own childhood in Baltimore. Five brothers came to America from Eastern Europe around the time of World War I and built a wallpaper business. For a while they did everything together, like in the old country. But as the movie goes along, the extended family begins to split apart. Some members move to the suburbs for more privacy and space. One leaves for a job in a different state. The big blowup comes over something that seems trivial but isn’t: The eldest of the brothers arrives late to a Thanksgiving dinner to find that the family has begun the meal without him.</p>
<p>“You cut the turkey without me?” he cries. “Your own flesh and blood! … You cut the turkey?” The pace of life is speeding up. Convenience, privacy, and mobility are more important than family loyalty. “The idea that they would eat before the brother arrived was a sign of disrespect,” Levinson told me recently when I asked him about that scene. “That was the real crack in the family. When you violate the protocol, the whole family structure begins to collapse.”</p>
<p>As the years go by in the movie, the extended family plays a smaller and smaller role. By the 1960s, there’s no extended family at Thanksgiving. It’s just a young father and mother and their son and daughter, eating turkey off trays in front of the television. In the final scene, the main character is living alone in a nursing home, wondering what happened. “In the end, you spend everything you’ve ever saved, sell everything you’ve ever owned, just to exist in a place like this.”</p>
<p>“In my childhood,” Levinson told me, “you’d gather around the grandparents and they would tell the family stories … Now individuals sit around the TV, watching other families’ stories.” The main theme of Avalon, he said, is “the decentralization of the family. And that has continued even further today. Once, families at least gathered around the television. Now each person has their own screen.”</p>
<p>This is the story of our times—the story of the family, once a dense cluster of many siblings and extended kin, fragmenting into ever smaller and more fragile forms. The initial result of that fragmentation, the nuclear family, didn’t seem so bad. But then, because the nuclear family is so brittle, the fragmentation continued. In many sectors of society, nuclear families fragmented into single-parent families, single-parent families into chaotic families or no families.</p>
<p>If you want to summarize the changes in family structure over the past century, the truest thing to say is this: We’ve made life freer for individuals and more unstable for families. We’ve made life better for adults but worse for children. We’ve moved from big, interconnected, and extended families, which helped protect the most vulnerable people in society from the shocks of life, to smaller, detached nuclear families (a married couple and their children), which give the most privileged people in society room to maximize their talents and expand their options. The shift from bigger and interconnected extended families to smaller and detached nuclear families ultimately led to a familial system that liberates the rich and ravages the working-class and the poor.</p>
<p>This article is about that process, and the devastation it has wrought—and about how Americans are now groping to build new kinds of family and find better ways to live.</p>

<h1 id="Part-I"><a href="#Part-I" class="headerlink" title="Part I"></a>Part I</h1><h3 id="The-Era-of-Extended-Clans"><a href="#The-Era-of-Extended-Clans" class="headerlink" title="The Era of Extended Clans"></a>The Era of Extended Clans</h3><p>Through the early parts of American history, most people lived in what, by today’s standards, were big, sprawling households. In 1800, three-quarters of American workers were farmers. Most of the other quarter worked in small family businesses, like dry-goods stores. People needed a lot of labor to run these enterprises. It was not uncommon for married couples to have seven or eight children. In addition, there might be stray aunts, uncles, and cousins, as well as unrelated servants, apprentices, and farmhands. (On some southern farms, of course, enslaved African Americans were also an integral part of production and work life.)</p>
<p>Steven Ruggles, a professor of history and population studies at the University of Minnesota, calls these “corporate families”—social units organized around a family business. According to Ruggles, in 1800, 90 percent of American families were corporate families. Until 1850, roughly three-quarters of Americans older than 65 lived with their kids and grandkids. Nuclear families existed, but they were surrounded by extended or corporate families.</p>
<p>Extended families have two great strengths. The first is resilience. An extended family is one or more families in a supporting web. Your spouse and children come first, but there are also cousins, in-laws, grandparents—a complex web of relationships among, say, seven, 10, or 20 people. If a mother dies, siblings, uncles, aunts, and grandparents are there to step in. If a relationship between a father and a child ruptures, others can fill the breach. Extended families have more people to share the unexpected burdens—when a kid gets sick in the middle of the day or when an adult unexpectedly loses a job.</p>
<p>A detached nuclear family, by contrast, is an intense set of relationships among, say, four people. If one relationship breaks, there are no shock absorbers. In a nuclear family, the end of the marriage means the end of the family as it was previously understood.</p>
<p>The second great strength of extended families is their socializing force. Multiple adults teach children right from wrong, how to behave toward others, how to be kind. Over the course of the 18th and 19th centuries, industrialization and cultural change began to threaten traditional ways of life. Many people in Britain and the United States doubled down on the extended family in order to create a moral haven in a heartless world. According to Ruggles, the prevalence of extended families living together <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=NdJP5iQRgy4C&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=steven+ruggles+university+of+minnesota+corporate+families&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Kzq-3xC0dZ&amp;sig=ACfU3U0l9wrlYDk2fRJ0nNWyc9JGa3y4WA&amp;hl=en&amp;ppis=_e&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi8l7XMrpfnAhWxm-AKHYCTAgsQ6AEwBXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=steven%20ruggles%20university%20of%20minnesota%20corporate%20families&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">roughly doubled from 1750 to 1900</a>, and this way of life was more common than at any time before or since.</p>
<p>During the Victorian era, the idea of “hearth and home” became a cultural ideal. The home “is a sacred place, a vestal temple, a temple of the hearth watched over by Household Gods, before whose faces none may come but those whom they can receive with love,” the great Victorian social critic John Ruskin wrote. This shift was led by the upper-middle class, which was coming to see the family less as an economic unit and more as an emotional and moral unit, a rectory for the formation of hearts and souls.</p>
<p>But while extended families have strengths, they can also be exhausting and stifling. They allow little privacy; you are forced to be in daily intimate contact with people you didn’t choose. There’s more stability but less mobility. Family bonds are thicker, but individual choice is diminished. You have less space to make your own way in life. In the Victorian era, families were patriarchal, favoring men in general and first-born sons in particular.</p>
<p>As factories opened in the big U.S. cities, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, young men and women left their extended families to chase the American dream. These young people married as soon as they could. A young man on a farm might wait until 26 to get married; in the lonely city, men married at 22 or 23. From 1890 to 1960, the average age of first marriage dropped by 3.6 years for men and 2.2 years for women.</p>
<p>The families they started were nuclear families. The decline of multigenerational cohabiting families exactly mirrors the decline in farm employment. Children were no longer raised to assume economic roles—they were raised so that at adolescence they could fly from the nest, become independent, and seek partners of their own. They were raised not for embeddedness but for autonomy. By the 1920s, the nuclear family with a male breadwinner had replaced the corporate family as the dominant family form. By 1960, 77.5 percent of all children were living with their two parents, who were married, and apart from their extended family.</p>

<h3 id="The-Short-Happy-Life-of-the-Nuclear-Family"><a href="#The-Short-Happy-Life-of-the-Nuclear-Family" class="headerlink" title="The Short, Happy Life of the Nuclear Family"></a>The Short, Happy Life of the Nuclear Family</h3><p>For a time, it all seemed to work. From 1950 to 1965, divorce rates dropped, fertility rates rose, and the American nuclear family seemed to be in wonderful shape. And most people seemed prosperous and happy. In these years, a kind of cult formed around this type of family—what McCall’s, the leading women’s magazine of the day, called “togetherness.” Healthy people lived in two-parent families. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/21/opinion/brooks-the-talent-society.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a 1957 survey</a>, more than half of the respondents said that unmarried people were “sick,” “immoral,” or “neurotic.”</p>
<p>During this period, a certain family ideal became engraved in our minds: a married couple with 2.5 kids. When we think of the American family, many of us still revert to this ideal. When we have debates about how to strengthen the family, we are thinking of the two-parent nuclear family, with one or two kids, probably living in some detached family home on some suburban street. We take it as the norm, even though this wasn’t the way most humans lived during the tens of thousands of years before 1950, and it isn’t the way most humans have lived during the 55 years since 1965.</p>
<p>Today, only a minority of American households are traditional two-parent nuclear families and only one-third of American individuals live in this kind of family. That 1950–65 window was not normal. It was a freakish historical moment when all of society conspired, wittingly and not, to obscure the essential fragility of the nuclear family.</p>
<p><img src="original.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>For one thing, most women were relegated to the home. Many corporations, well into the mid-20th century, barred married women from employment: Companies would hire single women, but if those women got married, they would have to quit. Demeaning and disempowering treatment of women was rampant. Women spent enormous numbers of hours trapped inside the home under the headship of their husband, raising children.</p>
<p>For another thing, nuclear families in this era were much more connected to other nuclear families than they are today—constituting a “<a href="http://www.public.asu.edu/~atssk/ssk_jmf87b.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modified extended family</a>,” as the sociologist Eugene Litwak calls it, “a coalition of nuclear families in a state of mutual dependence.” Even as late as the 1950s, before television and air-conditioning had fully caught on, people continued to live on one another’s front porches and were part of one another’s lives. Friends felt free to discipline one another’s children.</p>
<p>In his book <em>The Lost City</em>, the journalist Alan Ehrenhalt describes life in mid-century Chicago and its suburbs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To be a young homeowner in a suburb like Elmhurst in the 1950s was to participate in a communal enterprise that only the most determined loner could escape: barbecues, coffee klatches, volleyball games, baby-sitting co-ops and constant bartering of household goods, child rearing by the nearest parents who happened to be around, neighbors wandering through the door at any hour without knocking—all these were devices by which young adults who had been set down in a wilderness of tract homes made a community. It was a life lived in public.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, conditions in the wider society were ideal for family stability. The postwar period was a high-water mark of church attendance, unionization, social trust, and mass prosperity—all things that correlate with family cohesion. A man could relatively easily find a job that would allow him to be the breadwinner for a single-income family. By 1961, the median American man age 25 to 29 was <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13524-015-0440-z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earning nearly 400 percent more than his father had earned</a> at about the same age.</p>
<p>In short, the period from 1950 to 1965 demonstrated that a stable society can be built around nuclear families—so long as women are relegated to the household, nuclear families are so intertwined that they are basically extended families by another name, and every economic and sociological condition in society is working together to support the institution.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="Disintegration"><a href="#Disintegration" class="headerlink" title="Disintegration"></a>Disintegration</h3><p>But these conditions did not last. The constellation of forces that had briefly shored up the nuclear family began to fall away, and the sheltered family of the 1950s was supplanted by the stressed family of every decade since. Some of the strains were economic. Starting in the mid-’70s, young men’s wages declined, putting pressure on working-class families in particular. The major strains were cultural. Society became more individualistic and more self-oriented. People put greater value on privacy and autonomy. A rising feminist movement helped endow women with greater freedom to live and work as they chose.</p>
<p>A study of women’s magazines by the sociologists Francesca Cancian and Steven L. Gordon found that from 1900 to 1979, themes of putting family before self dominated in the 1950s: “Love means self-sacrifice and compromise.” In the 1960s and ’70s, putting self before family was prominent: “Love means self-expression and individuality.” Men absorbed these cultural themes, too. The master trend in Baby Boomer culture generally was liberation—“Free Bird,” “Born to Run,” “Ramblin’ Man.”</p>
<p>Eli Finkel, a psychologist and marriage scholar at Northwestern University, has argued that since the 1960s, the dominant family culture has been the “self-expressive marriage.” “Americans,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/opinion/sunday/the-all-or-nothing-marriage.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he has written</a>, “now look to marriage increasingly for self-discovery, self-esteem and personal growth.” Marriage, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=_gEDfhZp5s0C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the sociologists Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas</a>, “is no longer primarily about childbearing and childrearing. Now marriage is primarily about adult fulfillment.”</p>
<p>This cultural shift was very good for some adults, but it was not so good for families generally. Fewer relatives are around in times of stress to help a couple work through them. If you married for love, staying together made less sense when the love died. This attenuation of marital ties may have begun during the late 1800s: The number of divorces increased about fifteenfold from 1870 to 1920, and then climbed more or less continuously through the first several decades of the nuclear-family era. As the intellectual historian <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=QUFYneP-HQwC&amp;pg=PR20&amp;lpg=PR20&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Christopher Lasch noted in the late 1970s</a>, the American family didn’t start coming apart in the 1960s; it had been “coming apart for more than 100 years.”</p>
<p>Americans today have less family than ever before. From 1970 to 2012, the share of households consisting of married couples with kids has been cut in half. In 1960, according to census data, just 13 percent of all households were single-person households. In 2018, that figure was 28 percent. In 1850, 75 percent of Americans older than 65 lived with relatives; by 1990, only 18 percent did.</p>
<p>Over the past two generations, people have spent less and less time in marriage—they are marrying later, if at all, and divorcing more. In 1950, 27 percent of marriages ended in divorce; today, about 45 percent do. In 1960, 72 percent of American adults were married. In 2017, nearly half of American adults were single. According to a 2014 report from the Urban Institute, roughly 90 percent of Baby Boomer women and 80 percent of Gen X women married by age 40, while only about 70 percent of late-Millennial women were expected to do so—the lowest rate in U.S. history. And while more than four-fifths of American adults in a 2019 Pew Research Center survey said that getting married is not essential to living a fulfilling life, it’s not just the institution of marriage they’re eschewing: In 2004, 33 percent of Americans ages 18 to 34 were living without a romantic partner, according to the General Social Survey; by 2018, that number was up to 51 percent.</p>
<p>Over the past two generations, families have also gotten a lot smaller. The general American birth rate is half of what it was in 1960. In 2012, most American family households had no children. There are more American homes with pets than with kids. In 1970, about 20 percent of households had five or more people. As of 2012, only 9.6 percent did.</p>

<h5 id="We’re-likely-living-through-the-most-rapid-change-in-family-structure-in-human-history-The-causes-are-economic-cultural-and-institutional-all-at-once"><a href="#We’re-likely-living-through-the-most-rapid-change-in-family-structure-in-human-history-The-causes-are-economic-cultural-and-institutional-all-at-once" class="headerlink" title="We’re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history. The causes are economic, cultural, and institutional all at once."></a><em>We’re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history. The causes are economic, cultural, and institutional all at once.</em></h5><p>Over the past two generations, the physical space separating nuclear families has widened. Before, sisters-in-law shouted greetings across the street at each other from their porches. Kids would dash from home to home and eat out of whoever’s fridge was closest by. But lawns have grown more expansive and porch life has declined, creating a buffer of space that separates the house and family from anyone else. As Mandy Len Catron recently noted in <em><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2019/07/case-against-marriage/591973/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Atlantic</a></em>, married people are less likely to visit parents and siblings, and less inclined to help them do chores or offer emotional support. A code of family self-sufficiency prevails: Mom, Dad, and the kids are on their own, with a barrier around their island home.</p>
<p>Finally, over the past two generations, families have grown more unequal. America now has two entirely different family regimes. Among the highly educated, family patterns are almost as stable as they were in the 1950s; among the less fortunate, family life is often utter chaos. There’s a reason for that divide: Affluent people have the resources to effectively buy extended family, in order to shore themselves up. Think of all the child-rearing labor affluent parents now buy that used to be done by extended kin: babysitting, professional child care, tutoring, coaching, therapy, expensive after-school programs. (For that matter, think of how the affluent can hire therapists and life coaches for themselves, as replacement for kin or close friends.) These expensive tools and services not only support children’s development and help prepare them to compete in the meritocracy; by reducing stress and time commitments for parents, they preserve the amity of marriage. Affluent conservatives often pat themselves on the back for having stable nuclear families. They preach that everybody else should build stable families too. But then they ignore one of the main reasons their own families are stable: They can afford to purchase the support that extended family used to provide—and that the people they preach at, further down the income scale, cannot.</p>
<p>In 1970, the family structures of the rich and poor did not differ that greatly. Now there is a chasm between them. As of 2005, 85 percent of children born to upper-middle-class families were living with both biological parents when the mom was 40. Among working-class families, only 30 percent were. According to a 2012 report from the National Center for Health Statistics, college-educated women ages 22 to 44 have a 78 percent chance of having their first marriage last at least 20 years. Women in the same age range with a high-school degree or less have only about a 40 percent chance. Among Americans ages 18 to 55, only 26 percent of the poor and <a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The-Marriage-Divide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">39 percent of the working class</a> are currently married. In her book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=081572635X/theatla05-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Generation Unbound</a></em>, Isabel Sawhill, an economist at the Brookings Institution, cited research indicating that differences in family structure have “increased income inequality by 25 percent.” If the U.S. returned to the marriage rates of 1970, child poverty would be 20 percent lower. As Andrew Cherlin, a sociologist at Johns Hopkins University, once put it, “It is the privileged Americans who are marrying, and marrying helps them stay privileged.”</p>
<p>When you put everything together, we’re likely living through the most rapid change in family structure in human history. The causes are economic, cultural, and institutional all at once. People who grow up in a nuclear family tend to have a more individualistic mind-set than people who grow up in a multigenerational extended clan. People with an individualistic mind-set tend to be less willing to sacrifice self for the sake of the family, and the result is more family disruption. People who grow up in disrupted families have more trouble getting the education they need to have prosperous careers. People who don’t have prosperous careers have trouble building stable families, because of financial challenges and other stressors. The children in those families become more isolated and more traumatized.</p>
<p>Many people growing up in this era have no secure base from which to launch themselves and no well-defined pathway to adulthood. For those who have the human capital to explore, fall down, and have their fall cushioned, that means great freedom and opportunity—and for those who lack those resources, it tends to mean great confusion, drift, and pain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the past 50 years, federal and state governments have tried to mitigate the deleterious effects of these trends. They’ve tried to increase marriage rates, push down divorce rates, boost fertility, and all the rest. The focus has always been on strengthening the nuclear family, not the extended family. Occasionally, a discrete program will yield some positive results, but the widening of family inequality continues unabated.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The people who suffer the most from the decline in family support are the vulnerable—especially children. In 1960, roughly 5 percent of children were born to unmarried women. Now about 40 percent are. The Pew Research Center reported that 11 percent of children lived apart from their father in 1960. In 2010, 27 percent did. Now about half of American children will spend their childhood with both biological parents. Twenty percent of young adults have no contact at all with their father (though in some cases that’s because the father is deceased). American children are more likely to live in a single-parent household than children from any other country.</p>
<p>We all know stable and loving single-parent families. But on average, children of single parents or unmarried cohabiting parents tend to have worse health outcomes, worse mental-health outcomes, less academic success, more behavioral problems, and higher truancy rates than do children living with their two married biological parents. According to <a href="http://csweb.brookings.edu/content/research/essays/2014/saving-horatio-alger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">work by Richard V. Reeves</a>, a co-director of the Center on Children and Families at the Brookings Institution, if you are born into poverty and raised by your married parents, you have an 80 percent chance of climbing out of it. If you are born into poverty and raised by an unmarried mother, you have a 50 percent chance of remaining stuck.</p>
<p>It’s not just the lack of relationships that hurts children; it’s the churn. According to <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3556562?read-now=1&amp;seq=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a 2003 study that Andrew Cherlin cites</a>, 12 percent of American kids had lived in at least three “parental partnerships” before they turned 15. The transition moments, when mom’s old partner moves out or her new partner moves in, are the hardest on kids, Cherlin shows.</p>
<p>While children are the vulnerable group most obviously affected by recent changes in family structure, they are not the only one.</p>
<p>Consider single men. Extended families provided men with the fortifying influences of male bonding and female companionship. Today many American males spend the first 20 years of their life without a father and the next 15 without a spouse. Kay Hymowitz of the Manhattan Institute has spent a good chunk of her career <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/decline-of-family-loneliness-epidemic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examining the wreckage caused by the decline of the American family</a>, and cites evidence showing that, in the absence of the connection and meaning that family provides, unmarried men are less healthy—alcohol and drug abuse are common—earn less, and die sooner than married men.</p>

It was a freakish historical moment when all of society conspired to obscure its essential fragility.</em></h5><p>For women, the nuclear-family structure imposes different pressures. Though women have benefited greatly from the loosening of traditional family structures—they have more freedom to choose the lives they want—many mothers who decide to raise their young children without extended family nearby find that they have chosen a lifestyle that is brutally hard and isolating. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that women still spend significantly more time on housework and child care than men do, according to recent data. Thus, the reality we see around us: stressed, tired mothers trying to balance work and parenting, and having to reschedule work when family life gets messy.</p>
<p>Without extended families, older Americans have also suffered. According to the AARP, <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/research/surveys_statistics/life-leisure/2018/loneliness-social-connections-2018.doi.10.26419-2Fres.00246.001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35 percent of Americans over 45 say they are chronically lonely</a>. Many older people are now “elder orphans,” with no close relatives or friends to take care of them. In 2015, The New York Times ran an article called “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/18/nyregion/dying-alone-in-new-york-city.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Lonely Death of George Bell</a>,” about a family-less 72-year-old man who died alone and rotted in his Queens apartment for so long that by the time police found him, his body was unrecognizable.</p>
<p>Finally, because groups that have endured greater levels of discrimination tend to have more fragile families, African Americans have suffered disproportionately in the era of the detached nuclear family. Nearly half of black families are led by an unmarried single woman, compared with less than one-sixth of white families. (The high rate of black incarceration guarantees a shortage of available men to be husbands or caretakers of children.) According to census data from 2010, 25 percent of black women over 35 have never been married, compared with 8 percent of white women. Two-thirds of African American children lived in single-parent families in 2018, compared with a quarter of white children. Black single-parent families are most concentrated in precisely those parts of the country in which slavery was most prevalent. Research by John Iceland, a professor of sociology and demography at Penn State, suggests that the differences between white and black family structure explain 30 percent of the affluence gap between the two groups.</p>

At the core of her argument was the idea that families are “rigged to fail.” The structures that once supported the family no longer exist, she wrote. Jacobs was too pessimistic about many things, but for millions of people, the shift from big and/or extended families to detached nuclear families has indeed been a disaster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the social structures that support the family have decayed, the debate about it has taken on a mythical quality. Social conservatives insist that we can bring the nuclear family back. But the conditions that made for stable nuclear families in the 1950s are never returning. Conservatives have nothing to say to the kid whose dad has split, whose mom has had three other kids with different dads; “go live in a nuclear family” is really not relevant advice. If only a minority of households are traditional nuclear families, that means the majority are something else: single parents, never-married parents, blended families, grandparent-headed families, serial partnerships, and so on. Conservative ideas have not caught up with this reality.</p>
<p>Progressives, meanwhile, still talk like self-expressive individualists of the 1970s: <em>People should have the freedom to pick whatever family form works for them</em>. And, of course, they should. But many of the new family forms do not work well for most people—and while progressive elites say that all family structures are fine, their own behavior suggests that they believe otherwise. As the sociologist W. Bradford Wilcox has pointed out, highly educated progressives may talk a tolerant game on family structure when speaking about society at large, but they have extremely strict expectations for their own families. When Wilcox asked his University of Virginia students if they thought having a child out of wedlock was wrong, 62 percent said it was not wrong. When he asked the students how their own parents would feel if they themselves had a child out of wedlock, 97 percent said their parents would “freak out.” In a recent survey by the Institute for Family Studies, college-educated Californians ages 18 to 50 were less likely than those who hadn’t graduated from college to say that having a baby out of wedlock is wrong. But they were more likely to say that personally they did not approve of having a baby out of wedlock.</p>
<p>In other words, while social conservatives have a philosophy of family life they can’t operationalize, because it no longer is relevant, progressives have no philosophy of family life at all, because they don’t want to seem judgmental. The sexual revolution has come and gone, and it’s left us with no governing norms of family life, no guiding values, no articulated ideals. On this most central issue, our shared culture often has nothing relevant to say—and so for decades things have been falling apart.</p>
<p>The good news is that human beings adapt, even if politics are slow to do so. When one family form stops working, people cast about for something new—sometimes finding it in something very old.</p>
<h1 id="Part-II"><a href="#Part-II" class="headerlink" title="Part II"></a>Part II</h1><h3 id="Redefining-Kinship"><a href="#Redefining-Kinship" class="headerlink" title="Redefining Kinship"></a>Redefining Kinship</h3><p>In the beginning was the band. For tens of thousands of years, people commonly lived in small bands of, say, 25 people, which linked up with perhaps 20 other bands to form a tribe. People in the band went out foraging for food and brought it back to share. They hunted together, fought wars together, made clothing for one another, looked after one another’s kids. In every realm of life, they relied on their extended family and wider kin.</p>
<p>Except they didn’t define kin the way we do today. We think of kin as those biologically related to us. But throughout most of human history, kinship was something you could create.</p>
<p>Anthropologists have been arguing for decades about what exactly kinship is. Studying traditional societies, they have found wide varieties of created kinship among different cultures. For the Ilongot people of the Philippines, people who migrated somewhere together are kin. For the New Guineans of the Nebilyer Valley, kinship is created by sharing grease—the life force found in mother’s milk or sweet potatoes. The Chuukese people in Micronesia have a saying: “My sibling from the same canoe”; if two people survive a dangerous trial at sea, then they become kin. On the Alaskan North Slope, the Inupiat name their children after dead people, and those children are considered members of their namesake’s family.</p>
<p>In other words, for vast stretches of human history people lived in extended families consisting of not just people they were related to but people they chose to cooperate with. An international research team recently did <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/10/171005141759.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a genetic analysis of people who were buried together</a>—and therefore presumably lived together—34,000 years ago in what is now Russia. They found that the people who were buried together were not closely related to one another. In <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/279286429_Co-residence_patterns_in_hunter-gatherer_societies_show_unique_human_social_structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a study</a> of 32 present-day foraging societies, primary kin—parents, siblings, and children—usually made up less than 10 percent of a residential band. Extended families in traditional societies may or may not have been genetically close, but they were probably emotionally closer than most of us can imagine. In a beautiful essay on kinship, Marshall Sahlins, an anthropologist at the University of Chicago, says that kin in many such societies share a “mutuality of being.” The late religion scholar J. Prytz-Johansen wrote that kinship is experienced as an “inner solidarity” of souls. The late South African anthropologist Monica Wilson described kinsmen as “mystically dependent” on one another. Kinsmen belong to one another, Sahlins writes, because they see themselves as “members of one another.”</p>
<p>Back in the 17th and 18th centuries, when European Protestants came to North America, their relatively individualistic culture existed alongside Native Americans’ very communal culture. In his book <em>Tribe</em>, Sebastian Junger describes what happened next: While European settlers kept defecting to go live with Native American families, almost no Native Americans ever defected to go live with European families. Europeans occasionally captured Native Americans and forced them to come live with them. They taught them English and educated them in Western ways. But almost every time they were able, the indigenous Americans fled. European settlers were sometimes captured by Native Americans during wars and brought to live in Native communities. They rarely tried to run away. This bothered the Europeans. They had the superior civilization, so why were people voting with their feet to go live in another way?</p>
<p>When you read such accounts, you can’t help but wonder whether our civilization has somehow made a gigantic mistake.</p>
<p>We can’t go back, of course. Western individualists are no longer the kind of people who live in prehistoric bands. We may even no longer be the kind of people who were featured in the early scenes of Avalon. We value privacy and individual freedom too much.</p>
<p>Our culture is oddly stuck. We want stability and rootedness, but also mobility, dynamic capitalism, and the liberty to adopt the lifestyle we choose. We want close families, but not the legal, cultural, and sociological constraints that made them possible. We’ve seen the wreckage left behind by the collapse of the detached nuclear family. We’ve seen the rise of opioid addiction, of suicide, of depression, of inequality—all products, in part, of a family structure that is too fragile, and a society that is too detached, disconnected, and distrustful. And yet we can’t quite return to a more collective world. The words the historians Steven Mintz and Susan Kellogg wrote in 1988 are even truer today: “Many Americans are groping for a new paradigm of American family life, but in the meantime a profound sense of confusion and ambivalence reigns.”</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="From-Nuclear-Families-to-Forged-Families"><a href="#From-Nuclear-Families-to-Forged-Families" class="headerlink" title="From Nuclear Families to Forged Families"></a>From Nuclear Families to Forged Families</h3><p>Yet recent signs suggest at least the possibility that a new family paradigm is emerging. Many of the statistics I’ve cited are dire. But they describe the past—what got us to where we are now. In reaction to family chaos, accumulating evidence suggests, the prioritization of family is beginning to make a comeback. Americans are experimenting with new forms of kinship and extended family in search of stability.</p>
<p>Usually behavior changes before we realize that a new cultural paradigm has emerged. Imagine hundreds of millions of tiny arrows. In times of social transformation, they shift direction—a few at first, and then a lot. Nobody notices for a while, but then eventually people begin to recognize that a new pattern, and a new set of values, has emerged.</p>
<p>That may be happening now—in part out of necessity but in part by choice. Since the 1970s, and especially since the 2008 recession, economic pressures have pushed Americans toward greater reliance on family. Starting around 2012, the share of children living with married parents began to inch up. And college students have more contact with their parents than they did a generation ago. We tend to deride this as helicopter parenting or a failure to launch, and it has its excesses. But the educational process is longer and more expensive these days, so it makes sense that young adults rely on their parents for longer than they used to.</p>
<p>In 1980, only 12 percent of Americans lived in multigenerational households. But the financial crisis of 2008 prompted a sharp rise in multigenerational homes. Today 20 percent of Americans—<a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/04/05/a-record-64-million-americans-live-in-multigenerational-households/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">64 million people, an all-time high</a>—live in multigenerational homes.</p>
<p>The revival of the extended family has largely been driven by young adults moving back home. In 2014, <a href="https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2016/05/24/for-first-time-in-modern-era-living-with-parents-edges-out-other-living-arrangements-for-18-to-34-year-olds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">35 percent</a> of American men ages 18 to 34 lived with their parents. In time this shift might show itself to be mostly healthy, impelled <a href="https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2018/05/millennial-family-caregivers.pdf?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not just by economic necessity but by beneficent social impulses</a>; polling data suggest that many young people are already looking ahead to helping their parents in old age.</p>
<p>Another chunk of the revival is attributable to seniors moving in with their children. The percentage of seniors who live alone peaked around 1990. Now more than a fifth of Americans 65 and over live in multigenerational homes. This doesn’t count the large share of seniors who are moving to be close to their grandkids but not into the same household.</p>
<p>Immigrants and people of color—many of whom face greater economic and social stress—are more likely to live in extended-family households. More than 20 percent of Asians, black people, and Latinos live in multigenerational households, compared with 16 percent of white people. As America becomes more diverse, extended families are becoming more common.</p>
<p>African Americans have always relied on extended family more than white Americans do. “Despite the forces working to separate us—slavery, Jim Crow, forced migration, the prison system, gentrification—we have maintained an incredible commitment to each other,” Mia Birdsong, the author of the forthcoming book How We Show Up, told me recently. “The reality is, black families are expansive, fluid, and brilliantly rely on the support, knowledge, and capacity of ‘the village’ to take care of each other. Here’s an illustration: The white researcher/social worker/whatever sees a child moving between their mother’s house, their grandparents’ house, and their uncle’s house and sees that as ‘instability.’ But what’s actually happening is the family (extended and chosen) is leveraging all of its resources to raise that child.”</p>
<p>The black extended family survived even under slavery, and all the forced family separations that involved. Family was essential in the Jim Crow South and in the inner cities of the North, as a way to cope with the stresses of mass migration and limited opportunities, and with structural racism. But government policy sometimes made it more difficult for this family form to thrive. I began my career as a police reporter in Chicago, writing about public-housing projects like Cabrini-Green. Guided by social-science research, politicians tore down neighborhoods of rickety low-rise buildings—uprooting the complex webs of social connection those buildings supported, despite high rates of violence and crime—and put up big apartment buildings. The result was a horror: violent crime, gangs taking over the elevators, the erosion of family and neighborly life. Fortunately, those buildings have since been torn down themselves, replaced by mixed-income communities that are more amenable to the profusion of family forms.</p>

Their answer is always a variation on a theme—the loneliness.</em></h5><p>The return of multigenerational living arrangements is already changing the built landscape. A 2016 survey by a real-estate consulting firm found that 44 percent of home buyers were looking for a home that would accommodate their elderly parents, and 42 percent wanted one that would accommodate their returning adult children. Home builders have responded by putting up houses that are what the construction firm Lennar calls “two homes under one roof.” These houses are carefully built so that family members can spend time together while also preserving their privacy. Many of these homes have a shared mudroom, laundry room, and common area. But the “in-law suite,” the place for aging parents, has its own entrance, kitchenette, and dining area. The “Millennial suite,” the place for boomeranging adult children, has its own driveway and entrance too. These developments, of course, cater to those who can afford houses in the first place—but they speak to a common realization: Family members of different generations need to do more to support one another.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most interesting extended families are those that stretch across kinship lines. The past several years have seen the rise of new living arrangements that bring nonbiological kin into family or familylike relationships. On the website CoAbode, single mothers can find other single mothers interested in sharing a home. All across the country, you can find co-housing projects, in which groups of adults live as members of an extended family, with separate sleeping quarters and shared communal areas. Common, a real-estate-development company that launched in 2015, operates more than 25 co-housing communities, in six cities, where young singles can live this way. Common also recently teamed up with another developer, Tishman Speyer, to launch Kin, a co-housing community for young parents. Each young family has its own living quarters, but the facilities also have shared play spaces, child-care services, and family-oriented events and outings.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These experiments, and others like them, suggest that while people still want flexibility and some privacy, they are casting about for more communal ways of living, guided by a still-developing set of values. At a co-housing community in Oakland, California, called <a href="https://www.temescalcommons.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Temescal Commons</a>, the 23 members, ranging in age from 1 to 83, live in a complex with nine housing units. This is not some rich Bay Area hipster commune. The apartments are small, and the residents are middle- and working-class. They have a shared courtyard and a shared industrial-size kitchen where residents prepare a communal dinner on Thursday and Sunday nights. Upkeep is a shared responsibility. The adults babysit one another’s children, and members borrow sugar and milk from one another. The older parents counsel the younger ones. When members of this extended family have suffered bouts of unemployment or major health crises, the whole clan has rallied together.</p>
<p>Courtney E. Martin, a writer who focuses on how people are redefining the American dream, is a Temescal Commons resident. “I really love that our kids grow up with different versions of adulthood all around, especially different versions of masculinity,” she told me. “We consider all of our kids all of our kids.” Martin has a 3-year-old daughter, Stella, who has a special bond with a young man in his 20s that never would have taken root outside this extended-family structure. “Stella makes him laugh, and David feels awesome that this 3-year-old adores him,” Martin said. This is the kind of magic, she concluded, that wealth can’t buy. You can only have it through time and commitment, by joining an extended family. This kind of community would fall apart if residents moved in and out. But at least in this case, they don’t.</p>
<p>As Martin was talking, I was struck by one crucial difference between the old extended families like those in Avalon and the new ones of today: the role of women. The extended family in Avalon thrived because all the women in the family were locked in the kitchen, feeding 25 people at a time. In 2008, a team of American and Japanese researchers found that women in multigenerational households in Japan were at greater risk of heart disease than women living with spouses only, likely because of stress. But today’s extended-family living arrangements have much more diverse gender roles.</p>
<p>And yet in at least one respect, the new families Americans are forming would look familiar to our hunter-gatherer ancestors from eons ago. That’s because they are chosen families—they transcend traditional kinship lines.</p>
<p><img src="1.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The modern chosen-family movement came to prominence in San Francisco in the 1980s among gay men and lesbians, many of whom had become estranged from their biological families and had only one another for support in coping with the trauma of the AIDS crisis. In her book, Families We Choose: Lesbians, Gays, Kinship, the anthropologist Kath Weston writes, “The families I saw gay men and lesbians creating in the Bay Area tended to have extremely fluid boundaries, not unlike kinship organization among sectors of the African-American, American Indian, and white working class.”</p>
<p>She continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like their heterosexual counterparts, most gay men and lesbians insisted that family members are people who are “there for you,” people you can count on emotionally and materially. “They take care of me,” said one man, “I take care of them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These groups are what Daniel Burns, a political scientist at the University of Dallas, calls “forged families.” Tragedy and suffering have pushed people together in a way that goes deeper than just a convenient living arrangement. They become, as the anthropologists say, “fictive kin.”</p>
<p>Over the past several decades, the decline of the nuclear family has created an epidemic of trauma—millions have been set adrift because what should have been the most loving and secure relationship in their life broke. Slowly, but with increasing frequency, these drifting individuals are coming together to create forged families. These forged families have a feeling of determined commitment. The members of your chosen family are the people who will show up for you no matter what. On Pinterest you can find placards to hang on the kitchen wall where forged families gather: “Family isn’t always blood. It’s the people in your life who want you in theirs; the ones who accept you for who you are. The ones who would do anything to see you smile &amp; who love you no matter what.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two years ago, I started something called Weave: The Social Fabric Project. Weave exists to support and draw attention to people and organizations around the country who are building community. Over time, my colleagues and I have realized that one thing most of the Weavers have in common is this: They provide the kind of care to nonkin that many of us provide only to kin—the kind of support that used to be provided by the extended family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lisa Fitzpatrick, who was a health-care executive in New Orleans, <a href="https://www.apexyouthcenter.org/5-hour-energy-helps-apex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is a Weaver</a>. One day she was sitting in the passenger seat of a car when she noticed two young boys, 10 or 11, lifting something heavy. It was a gun. They used it to shoot her in the face. It was a gang-initiation ritual. When she recovered, she realized that she was just collateral damage. The real victims were the young boys who had to shoot somebody to get into a family, their gang.</p>
<p>She quit her job and began working with gang members. She opened her home to young kids who might otherwise join gangs. One Saturday afternoon, 35 kids were hanging around her house. She asked them why they were spending a lovely day at the home of a middle-aged woman. They replied, “You were the first person who ever opened the door.”</p>
<p>In Salt Lake City, an organization called the Other Side Academy provides serious felons with an extended family. Many of the men and women who are admitted into the program have been allowed to leave prison, where they were generally serving long sentences, but must live in a group home and work at shared businesses, a moving company and a thrift store. The goal is to transform the character of each family member. During the day they work as movers or cashiers. Then they dine together and gather several evenings a week for something called “Games”: They call one another out for any small moral failure—being sloppy with a move; not treating another family member with respect; being passive-aggressive, selfish, or avoidant.</p>
<p>Games is not polite. The residents scream at one another in order to break through the layers of armor that have built up in prison. Imagine two gigantic men covered in tattoos screaming “Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!” At the session I attended, I thought they would come to blows. But after the anger, there’s a kind of closeness that didn’t exist before. Men and women who have never had a loving family suddenly have “relatives” who hold them accountable and demand a standard of moral excellence. Extreme integrity becomes a way of belonging to the clan. The Other Side Academy provides unwanted people with an opportunity to give care, and creates out of that care a ferocious forged family.</p>
<p>I could tell you hundreds of stories like this, about organizations that bring traumatized vets into extended-family settings, or nursing homes that house preschools so that senior citizens and young children can go through life together. In Baltimore, a nonprofit called Thread surrounds underperforming students with volunteers, some of whom are called “grandparents.” In Chicago, Becoming a Man helps disadvantaged youth form family-type bonds with one another. In Washington, D.C., I recently met a group of middle-aged female scientists—one a celebrated cellular biologist at the National Institutes of Health, another an astrophysicist—who live together in a Catholic lay community, pooling their resources and sharing their lives. The variety of forged families in America today is endless.</p>

All forms of inequality are cruel, but family inequality may be the cruelest. It damages the heart.</em></h5><p>You may be part of a forged family yourself. I am. In 2015, I was invited to the house of a couple named Kathy and David, who had created an extended-family-like group in D.C. called All Our Kids, or AOK-DC. Some years earlier, Kathy and David had had a kid in D.C. Public Schools who had a friend named James, who often had nothing to eat and no place to stay, so they suggested that he stay with them. That kid had a friend in similar circumstances, and those friends had friends. By the time I joined them, roughly 25 kids were having dinner every Thursday night, and several of them were sleeping in the basement.</p>
<p>I joined the community and never left—they became my chosen family. We have dinner together on Thursday nights, celebrate holidays together, and vacation together. The kids call Kathy and David Mom and Dad. In the early days, the adults in our clan served as parental figures for the young people—replacing their broken cellphones, supporting them when depression struck, raising money for their college tuition. When a young woman in our group needed a new kidney, David gave her one of his.</p>
<p>We had our primary biological families, which came first, but we also had this family. Now the young people in this forged family are in their 20s and need us less. David and Kathy have left Washington, but they stay in constant contact. The dinners still happen. We still see one another and look after one another. The years of eating together and going through life together have created a bond. If a crisis hit anyone, we’d all show up. The experience has convinced me that everybody should have membership in a forged family with people completely unlike themselves.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ever since I started working on this article, a chart has been haunting me. It plots the percentage of people living alone in a country against that nation’s GDP. There’s a strong correlation. Nations where a fifth of the people live alone, like Denmark and Finland, are a lot richer than nations where almost no one lives alone, like the ones in Latin America or Africa. Rich nations have smaller households than poor nations. The average German lives in a household with 2.7 people. The average Gambian lives in a household with 13.8 people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That chart suggests two things, especially in the American context. First, the market wants us to live alone or with just a few people. That way we are mobile, unattached, and uncommitted, able to devote an enormous number of hours to our jobs. Second, when people who are raised in developed countries get money, they buy privacy.</p>
<p>For the privileged, this sort of works. The arrangement enables the affluent to dedicate more hours to work and email, unencumbered by family commitments. They can afford to hire people who will do the work that extended family used to do. But a lingering sadness lurks, an awareness that life is emotionally vacant when family and close friends aren’t physically present, when neighbors aren’t geographically or metaphorically close enough for you to lean on them, or for them to lean on you. Today’s crisis of connection flows from the impoverishment of family life.</p>
<p>I often ask African friends who have immigrated to America what most struck them when they arrived. Their answer is always a variation on a theme—the loneliness. It’s the empty suburban street in the middle of the day, maybe with a lone mother pushing a baby carriage on the sidewalk but nobody else around.</p>
<p>For those who are not privileged, the era of the isolated nuclear family has been a catastrophe. It’s led to broken families or no families; to merry-go-round families that leave children traumatized and isolated; to senior citizens dying alone in a room. All forms of inequality are cruel, but family inequality may be the cruelest. It damages the heart. Eventually family inequality even undermines the economy the nuclear family was meant to serve: Children who grow up in chaos have trouble becoming skilled, stable, and socially mobile employees later on.</p>
<p>When hyper-individualism kicked into gear in the 1960s, people experimented with new ways of living that embraced individualistic values. Today we are crawling out from the wreckage of that hyper-individualism—which left many families detached and unsupported—and people are experimenting with more connected ways of living, with new shapes and varieties of extended families. Government support can help nurture this experimentation, particularly for the working-class and the poor, with things like child tax credits, coaching programs to improve parenting skills in struggling families, subsidized early education, and expanded parental leave. While the most important shifts will be cultural, and driven by individual choices, family life is under so much social stress and economic pressure in the poorer reaches of American society that no recovery is likely without some government action.</p>
<p>The two-parent family, meanwhile, is not about to go extinct. For many people, especially those with financial and social resources, it is a great way to live and raise children. But a new and more communal ethos is emerging, one that is consistent with 21st-century reality and 21st-century values.</p>
<p>When we discuss the problems confronting the country, we don’t talk about family enough. It feels too judgmental. Too uncomfortable. Maybe even too religious. But the blunt fact is that the nuclear family has been crumbling in slow motion for decades, and many of our other problems—with education, mental health, addiction, the quality of the labor force—stem from that crumbling. We’ve left behind the nuclear-family paradigm of 1955. For most people it’s not coming back. Americans are hungering to live in extended and forged families, in ways that are new and ancient at the same time. This is a significant opportunity, a chance to thicken and broaden family relationships, a chance to allow more adults and children to live and grow under the loving gaze of a dozen pairs of eyes, and be caught, when they fall, by a dozen pairs of arms. For decades we have been eating at smaller and smaller tables, with fewer and fewer kin.</p>
<p>It’s time to find ways to bring back the big tables.</p>

<p>跟大家说一下今天上午的进展，上午我们一共有三个人进入了小区，一个朋友在外面，找到住址的时候，视频中的张大爷正好出去收废品去了，期间我们与物业管理人员聊了聊，张大爷回来后到他家里和他及其家人聊了很久，大致情况如下：1、张大爷：年轻的时候应该是在类似废品分拣处理的地方工作，因此具有废物回收的意识，可以说是有爱好也有技术基础，由于废品不能及时出货，多数时候堆放在自己一楼的窗下，也因此多与物业发生矛盾，大爷几年前腿摔伤过，留了钢钉，走路有些跛，大爷有残疾人证明，领低保，过节社区也会发一些东西照顾；2、家庭：张大爷与哥哥嫂子生活在一起，已经有18年了，能看出哥嫂真的把他当做家里人；3、打人者：据说好像姓李，物业人员，小区物业人员经常来清理张大爷的废品，毕竟存在安全卫生隐患，多数人比较客气，有时还会出钱回收废品，只有这个李某来了就骂人，很难听，家属都不愿意搭理他，这部分是家属反映的不是物业说的，具物业负责人反映，这个打人者昨天已经被辞退；4、起因：由于疫情，这次的清理工作更深入，要没收三轮车，张大爷去阻拦，发生了视频中的暴力行为，当时嫂子在屋内并不知情（应该是习惯了清理，没有特别注意），后来看了对面楼的视频才知道这次这么严重；5、伤情：大爷说昨天一晚上没睡，不过看着精神状态很好，早上又去工作了，我们询问是否需要去医院，家属表示不用；6、捐款：在我们再三表示全国人民的关心和捐款意愿后，哥嫂仍说不需要并感谢大家的关心，我们表示如果不需要钱，我们捐一些口罩酒精等防护用品，哥嫂还是不需要，这个我随后再想办法；7、警方：由于我们是非小区人员进入小区，社区负责人报了警，警方在我们离开时正好赶到，了解情况后他们表示这个事情还在处理中，会给一个结果。<br>事情经过大概是这样，这个家庭就是我们天津普普通通的老百姓，张大爷与家人生活在一起可以说有生活保障，我个人觉得每一种生活方式都值得被尊重，希望警方可以给施暴者以严惩！</p>

<p>没有调查就没有发言权，所以，我亲自跑到彰武楼调查了一番。</p>
<p>这个地方就在本溪路地铁站，离我家饭店不远，我吃完饭坐上公交直接就过去了。</p>
<p>进入社区之后，还不是很好找，彰武楼小区很大，找了十来分钟才找到，通过反复比对，确认自己的确找到了。</p>
<p>我拍照的时候，有一个穿着粉色大衣的大姐路过，问我是干什么的，我说我也是天津人，住得离这儿不远，也有亲戚住这儿，知道这件事到这儿来看看，了解一下情况。</p>
<p>我问她：“怎么，您是咱社区工作人员吗？”</p>
<p>粉色大衣的姐姐说：“是的，我是居委会的，您是记者还是？”</p>
<p>“我不是记者，算是一个热心市民吧，我是天津的一个大v，之所以过来，是因为网上能看到的仅仅有一个视频片段，这个事情的前因后果都不清楚的情况下，很多网民就开始骂街，骂个人也就算了，很多人直接指着天津市鼻子骂，作为天津人我觉得很耻辱，所以我想亲自过来，了解一下情况，挨骂也得明明白白的挨骂，不能什么事都不知道就挨骂。”</p>
<p>大姐了解了我的来意，开始和我讲事情的前因后果，讲得差不多的时候，正好开过来一辆车，车上的人看到我和居委会的人聊天，开车窗问怎么回事，我亮明身份讲清来意之后，车上的人也下来了，他是物业经理，是那几个保安的顶头上司。</p>
<p>物业经理又从头到尾把这件事和我说了一遍，说的和居委会那位女同志是一样的，不存在串通，也不存在事先沟通和准备，都是站一块话赶话聊出来的。</p>
<p>这是他们两个人，和物业经理的车，为了保护人家的隐私权，没有拍脸和车牌号，仅仅为证明我的确去了，也的确他们沟通过的事实。</p>
<p>这两个人和我叙述的时候是分别叙述的，并没有串通什么的，两个人说的基本一致。有人说我造假，衣服明明灰的你却说是粉的，这么说的人一点脑子没有，这衣服看上去真的是粉的，不知道为什么一拍是灰的，我要真造假还能颜色都对不上？服气了也是。</p>
<p>接下来，我给大家原封不动的叙述一遍，还原一下事情经过。</p>
<p>这个拾荒老人叫老四，说是老人，其实不老，今年57岁，在彰武楼拾荒已经有很长时间了，和物业居委会的都很熟，并不是不认识的关系。</p>
<p>物业经理给我指了前方这片空地，说：“现在的样子是收拾完的样子，都是我们给收拾的，之前他用一大片铁丝网，把这块公共空地圈起来一大片，里面堆满了他四处捡来的垃圾，味道很难闻，一到夏天苍蝇蚊子一大堆，而且有很多纸夹子，明确属于消防安全隐患，前后楼的居民已经反映过他很多次了。”</p>
<p>尤其前段时间，是全国创文创卫期间，基层工作人员忙的不行，天天盯卫生，从当官的到公务员都出去满大街捡烟头，在这种情况下，他收集的这些垃圾就更给政府部门的工作拖后腿了。</p>
<p>于是，物业和居委会和他商量过很多次，不要再收垃圾了，他捡来的垃圾能卖十块二十块的，他们出价三五十收走，弄来一辆破三轮，一百块钱，他们三百收，之所以高价收，就是希望他不要再这么干了。</p>
<p>但是没有用，他还是屡次三番，不顾居民的反映，不顾街道物业的劝说，一次次的重操旧业，继续捡垃圾，连他自己的哥哥嫂子都劝过他很多次，他也不听。</p>
<p>老四并不是没有收入，他是街道的帮扶对象，一个人领着好几份钱，再过3年，60岁一退休，他还能领到一笔退休金，生活上完全不存在问题，在这种情况下，街道还经常给他送米送面送油，可以说是对他很好了。这个人也并不是你们所想的什么homeless，他的哥哥嫂子也住在这儿，天天照顾他，跟亲爹妈也差不多，生活上并不存在问题。</p>
<p>咱们国家搞得最好的就是精准扶贫，彰武楼小区在出这件事之前，在评比中拿了天津市第一还是红桥区第一记不清了，是一个基层工作做得其实还很好的社区。</p>
<p>什么流离失所衣食无着，不存在的。</p>
<p>其他的可能还存疑，关于帮扶这块绝对是真的，精准扶贫啊！这是发生在我身边的实实在在的事，我们附近不远就有公租房，很多人住着免费的公租房（有和租房价格相匹配的补贴），拿着各种各样的补贴，街道还经常送温暖给菜给肉给米面油，现在我遇到的老人没有骂共产党的，最不济的也会说一句“共产党这就算不错，相当好了”。</p>
<p>这个是绝对不能黑的。</p>
<p>那么，这次的事是怎么回事呢？</p>
<p>之前讲到，创文创卫期间，街道和居委会屡次劝说，他还是屡次收垃圾，现在到了疫情期间，他还是四处收垃圾，那么脏的垃圾，四处摆放，万一传播了新冠后果不堪设想，街道和居委会找他严肃的谈，别扒垃圾箱了，他还是不听，还是继续的收。</p>
<p>街道居委会说，你非得给大家添乱，再这样，我们就要强行收缴你的废品了，他也不听，照收不误。</p>
<p>然后我说：“这些情况我都知道，但是再怎么样，也不应该动手啊，干嘛还把他撂地下啊，还拖着走，控制住就得了啊。”</p>
<p>物业经理说：“好么，他手里有钉子你知道吗？“</p>
<p>“我们去收缴的时候，他手里拿着钉子，执法人员没办法了，也的确被他的行为激怒了，才动的手。”</p>
<p>事发之后，物业经理得知有人动手了，问清前因后果之后，虽然说是事出有因，还是第一时间就把那个保安给辞了。</p>
<p>当天晚上，物业找到了老四了解情况，得知老四也没有受伤，保安第一时间也辞了，东西也收缴完毕了，又再三劝说老四别再收了，老四也答应了，这件事其实就过去了。</p>
<p>然后就不知道被谁捅到网上了，今天早晨红桥区里的也给彰武楼党群服务中心打了电话，人民日报也来电话了。这些人跟我反馈的时候也觉得很冤枉，这一件事被拍下来就这样了，我们之前做了那么多好事，这么帮扶他，怎么没人说呢？</p>
<p>当然，既然是问话，我也不敢说保证百分之百的真实，但是我不傻，他们说这些话的时候，全都不假思索，侃侃而谈，编瞎话没有这样的，而且人家又都是公职人员，在我明确表示了会发到网上被大量网友看到的情况下，他们依然该说什么说什么，无论怎么看，我都觉得这不会是什么谎话。</p>
<p>至于那个红旗，我拍下来了，不得不说网友眼是真尖，还的确是个国旗。</p>
<p>关于这个国旗的事，居委会和物业其实也跟他说过，“国旗都得挂起来，挂在干净的地方，你这国旗插在你废品车上，周围都是废品，这么脏，这样算怎么回事啊”，他也不听。</p>
<p>事情前因后果就是这样，我相信他们说的是真实的，一不存在事先沟通，事发的时候是半夜，我早晨去的，没有什么统一口径的时间；二来都是话赶话跟聊天一样说的，两个人前后说的完全一致，应该就是这么回事。老人的话在家，我不是记者没有采访权，但是人家既然敢让我发到网上，就不太可能是假话，谁敢这么干？</p>
<p>说来说去，无论怎么样，那个保安也不应该动手，这是居委会和物业经理都认同的，他们也第一时间采取了补救措施，安抚了被打的拾荒者，各级部门也第一时间前来过问，了解了前因后果，被打的人也的确没有伤，保安也都已经被辞了，上级部门也觉得不是什么大事，才草草发了这么一条简短的声明出来。</p>
<p>而且，现在新的结果出来了，打人的保安被拘留了十天，我就告诉你们这件事不可能这么就完了，听信，你们总是没耐心。</p>
<p>但是，广大网友并不了解这里面的前因后果，他们只看到这样一个视频，一瞬间什么言论都出来了。</p>
<p>“无家可归者被保安欺负”。</p>
<p>“挖掘机是人，卡车是人，只有人不是人”。</p>
<p>“这个社会，老百姓一丁点尊严都没有“。</p>
<p>“老爷子一定是个很爱护国旗，我都能想象他把国旗擦得干干净净，珍而重之插在车上的样子”。</p>
<p>等等这些言论，都出来了，还拿了不少赞同。</p>
<p>光看这一个视频，的确是太容易得出这样的结论了，我也理解你们的义愤填膺，因为一开始的我也是气的不行，这个事件太容易让网友发泄情绪了，但是了解下来，事情根本不是网友们想象的那样。</p>
<p>而且，用国旗上纲上线，太严重了吧？内心戏是不是太多了点？</p>
<p>天津人也并不是你们说的那么恶。在天津， 一味蛮横无理的人是绝对不得人心的，天津人办事非常讲究一个“分寸”，一个“面子”，一上来就打人，这种事情在天津别说没有，发生的太少太少了，上来直接动手，这根本不符合天津人的办事特点。</p>
<p>一个听相声长大的城市，一个发大水满城人跑到大街上玩水，小小子背着小闺女上街逮鱼的城市，一个人人都会说相声，满大街段子手的城市，我不说，你们自己想想，会是你们口中的恶霸城市吗？</p>
<p>我是太了解天津人的性格了，所以我才觉得事情可能没有那么简单，才决定亲自跑去现场一探究竟，打人无论如何都是不对的，但毕竟还是事出有因。</p>
<p>以上就是事件的全部经过，我已经加了物业经理和居委会工作人员的微信，大家有什么想了解的，还可以继续问我，我还可以再去调查和了解。</p>
<p>作为一个天津人，讲几句公道话，天津在这次疫情中方方面面都做得很好，大家有目共睹，我也不希望自己的家乡被看作是欺压弱小的恶棍城市。</p>
<p>平心而论，老爷子里外里两千多，虽然说逢年过节有点福利，但稍微大点手真的不够花，他想多挣点钱，有错吗？也只能捡点废品。基层人员天天出去捡烟头容易吗？也不容易，但无论如何也不应该打人，但是他也有他的难处，众生皆苦，该抨击的我们要抨击，但是也要看到每个人都不容易，唉，人活着，可不就是这样么。</p>
<p>天津人平时讲究乐乐呵呵，根本也不是那么强凶霸道，这件事归根结底有错没有，有的，但请大家理解毕竟是事出有因。也希望大家不要把错误归咎到全部天津人头上，天津人真不都是这样，希望大家还是能嘴下留情，感谢你们！</p>
<p>其实，细想想，这位叔叔到手两千多，想多挣点钱，有错吗？没有。基层工作人员每天出去捡烟头，那么辛苦，工作性质决定一定要管他，有错吗？也没错。打人必须被抨击，这没错，但我同时看到了众生皆苦，每个人都在自己的命运里拼命的往上爬，多一点宽容和理解吧，因为不光是他们，我们自己，也不容易。</p>
<p>唉。</p>
<p>最后，我也欢迎大家把这篇答案截图转发到微博等其他平台，让大家都了解一下事情的另一面，不同的声音，是怎样的。</p>
<p>以上。</p>
<p>————————————————————————</p>
<p>PS：有人在评论里说我是收了钱洗白的，在此我对天发誓，我如果真的是收钱写文，哪怕一分钱，我全家出事故横死，我求老天爷帮我应验这个毒誓。</p>
<p>喷我的人，你们如果要喷我，最好跟我一样发一个毒誓，“答主如果没收钱我全家也横死”，要玩跟我这么玩。</p>
<p>还有人怀疑“怎么这么巧，你一去就都来了”，对此我也照样发毒誓，如果我说瞎话照样全家死，如果按照你们的逻辑，这个世界上就没有巧事了。</p>
<p>我玩知乎以来从没编过故事，我敢对自己说的每句话负责，我的人品，不是随便哪个过来就能质疑的。</p>
<p>另外，我找不到老人在哪，我也不是记者也不是什么公司机构，仅仅代表我个人是很难采访路人和老人的，一开始你们能看到的只有视频，我负责把物业和居委会的话传过来，老人那边其他的人在采访，你们不妨两边都听着，我所做的是尽自己一份力量去还原全貌，并没有主观臆断的下定论。</p>

    <title>You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus</title>
    <url>/clipping/You%E2%80%99re-Likely-to-Get-the-Coronavirus/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Atlantic</a>   <strong>JAMES HAMBLIN</strong>   <em>2020-2-24</em>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most cases are not life-threatening, which is also what makes the virus a historic challenge to contain.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In May 1997, a 3-year-old boy developed what at first seemed like the common cold. When his symptoms—sore throat, fever, and cough—persisted for six days, he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. There his cough worsened, and he began gasping for air. Despite intensive care, the boy died.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Puzzled by his rapid deterioration, doctors sent a sample of the boy’s sputum to China’s Department of Health. But the standard testing protocol couldn’t fully identify the virus that had caused the disease. The chief virologist decided to ship some of the sample to colleagues in other countries.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the boy’s sputum sat for a month, waiting for its turn in a slow process of antibody-matching analysis. The results eventually confirmed that this was a variant of influenza, the virus that has killed more people than any in history. But this type had never before been seen in humans. It was H5N1, or “avian flu,” discovered two decades prior, but known only to infect birds.</p>
<p>By then, it was August. Scientists sent distress signals around the world. The Chinese government swiftly killed 1.5 million chickens (over the protests of chicken farmers). Further cases were closely monitored and isolated. By the end of the year there were 18 known cases in humans. Six people died.</p>
<p>This was seen as a successful global response, and the virus was not seen again for years. In part, containment was possible because the disease was so severe: Those who got it became manifestly, extremely ill. H5N1 has a fatality rate of about 60 percent—if you get it, you’re likely to die. Yet since 2003, the virus has killed only 455 people. The much “milder” flu viruses, by contrast, kill fewer than 0.1 percent of people they infect, on average, but are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year.</p>
<p>Severe illness caused by viruses such as H5N1 also means that infected people can be identified and isolated, or that they died quickly. They do not walk around feeling just a little under the weather, seeding the virus. The new coronavirus (known technically as SARS-CoV-2) that has been spreading around the world can cause a respiratory illness that can be severe. The disease (known as COVID-19) seems to have a fatality rate of less than 2 percent—exponentially lower than most outbreaks that make global news. The virus has raised alarm not despite that low fatality rate, but because of it.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are similar to influenza viruses in that they both contain single strands of RNA.* Four coronaviruses commonly infect humans, causing colds. These are believed to have evolved in humans to maximize their own spread—which means sickening, but not killing, people. By contrast, the two prior novel coronavirus outbreaks—SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome, named for where the first outbreak occurred)—were picked up from animals, as was H5N1. These diseases were highly fatal to humans. If there were mild or asymptomatic cases, they were extremely few. Had there been more of them, the disease would have spread widely. Ultimately, SARS and MERS each killed fewer than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is already reported to have killed more than twice that number. With its potent mix of characteristics, this virus is unlike most that capture popular attention: It is deadly, but not too deadly. It makes people sick, but not in predictable, uniquely identifiable ways. Last week, 14 Americans tested positive on a cruise ship in Japan despite feeling fine—the new virus may be most dangerous because, it seems, it may sometimes cause no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>The world has responded with unprecedented speed and mobilization of resources. The new virus was identified extremely quickly. Its genome was sequenced by Chinese scientists and shared around the world within weeks. The global scientific community has shared genomic and clinical data at unprecedented rates. Work on a vaccine is well under way. The Chinese government enacted dramatic containment measures, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency of international concern. All of this happened in a fraction of the time it took to even identify H5N1 in 1997. And yet the outbreak continues to spread.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch is exacting in his diction, even for an epidemiologist. Twice in our conversation he started to say something, then paused and said, “Actually, let me start again.” So it’s striking when one of the points he wanted to get exactly right was this: “I think the likely outcome is that it will ultimately not be containable.”</p>
<p>Containment is the first step in responding to any outbreak. In the case of COVID-19, the possibility (however implausible) of preventing a pandemic seemed to play out in a matter of days. Starting in January, China began cordoning off progressively larger areas, radiating outward from the city of Wuhan and eventually encapsulating some 100 million people. People were barred from leaving home, and lectured by drones if they were caught outside. Nonetheless, the virus has now been found in 24 countries.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent ineffectiveness of such measures—relative to their inordinate social and economic cost, at least—the crackdown continues to escalate. Under political pressure to “stop” the virus, last Thursday the Chinese government announced that officials in Hubei province would be going door-to-door, testing people for fevers and looking for signs of illness, then sending all potential cases to quarantine camps. But even with the ideal containment, the virus’s spread may have been inevitable. Testing people who are already extremely sick is an imperfect strategy if people can spread the virus without even feeling bad enough to stay home from work.</p>
<p>Lipsitch predicts that within the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. But, he clarifies emphatically, this does not mean that all will have severe illnesses. “It’s likely that many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic,” he said. As with influenza, which is often life-threatening to people with chronic health conditions and of older age, most cases pass without medical care. (Overall, about 14 percent of people with influenza have no symptoms.)</p>
<p>Lipsitch is far from alone in his belief that this virus will continue to spread widely. The emerging consensus among epidemiologists is that the most likely outcome of this outbreak is a new seasonal disease—a fifth “endemic” coronavirus. With the other four, people are not known to develop long-lasting immunity. If this one follows suit, and if the disease continues to be as severe as it is now, “cold and flu season” could become “cold and flu and COVID-19 season.”</p>
<p>At this point, it is not even known how many people are infected. As of Sunday, there have been 35 confirmed cases in the U.S., according to the World Health Organization. But Lipsitch’s “very, very rough” estimate when we spoke a week ago (banking on “multiple assumptions piled on top of each other,” he said) was that 100 or 200 people in the U.S. were infected. That’s all it would take to seed the disease widely. The rate of spread would depend on how contagious the disease is in milder cases. On Friday, Chinese scientists reported in the medical journal JAMA an apparent case of asymptomatic spread of the virus, from a patient with a normal chest CT scan. The researchers concluded with stolid understatement that if this finding is not a bizarre abnormality, “the prevention of COVID-19 infection would prove challenging.”</p>
<p>Even if Lipsitch’s estimates were off by orders of magnitude, they wouldn’t likely change the overall prognosis. “Two hundred cases of a flu-like illness during flu season—when you’re not testing for it—is very hard to detect,” Lipsitch said. “But it would be really good to know sooner rather than later whether that’s correct, or whether we’ve miscalculated something. The only way to do that is by testing.”</p>
<p>Originally, doctors in the U.S. were advised not to test people unless they had been to China or had contact with someone who had been diagnosed with the disease. Within the past two weeks, the CDC said it would start screening people in five U.S. cities, in an effort to give some idea of how many cases are actually out there. But tests are still not widely available. As of Friday, the Association of Public Health Laboratories said that only California, Nebraska, and Illinois had the capacity to test people for the virus.</p>
<p>With so little data, prognosis is difficult. But the concern that this virus is beyond containment—that it will be with us indefinitely—is nowhere more apparent than in the global race to find a vaccine, one of the clearest strategies for saving lives in the years to come.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the past month, stock prices of a small pharmaceutical company named Inovio have more than doubled. In mid-January, it reportedly discovered a vaccine for the new coronavirus. This claim has been repeated in many news reports, even though it is technically inaccurate. Like other drugs, vaccines require a long testing process to see whether they indeed protect people from disease, and do so safely. What this company—and others—has done is copy a bit of the virus’s RNA that one day could prove to work as a vaccine. It’s a promising first step, but to call it a discovery is like announcing a new surgery after sharpening a scalpel.</p>
<p>Though genetic sequencing is now extremely fast, making vaccines is as much art as science. It involves finding a viral sequence that will reliably cause a protective immune-system memory but not trigger an acute inflammatory response that would itself cause symptoms. (While the influenza vaccine cannot cause the flu, the CDC warns that it can cause “flu-like symptoms.”) Hitting this sweet spot requires testing, first in lab models and animals, and eventually in people. One does not simply ship a billion viral gene fragments around the world to be injected into everyone at the moment of discovery.</p>
<p>Inovio is far from the only small biotech company venturing to create a sequence that strikes that balance. Others include Moderna, CureVac, and Novavax. Academic researchers are also on the case, at Imperial College London and other universities, as are federal scientists in several countries, including at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Anthony Fauci, the head of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote in JAMA in January that the agency was working at historic speed to find a vaccine. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, researchers moved from obtaining the genomic sequence of the virus and into a phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine in 20 months. Fauci wrote that his team has since compressed that timeline to just over three months for other viruses, and for the new coronavirus, “they hope to move even faster.”</p>
<p>New models have sprung up in recent years, too, that promise to speed up vaccine development. One is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), which was launched in Norway in 2017 to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines. Its founders include the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The group’s money is now flowing to Inovio and other small biotech start-ups, encouraging them to get into the risky business of vaccine development. The group’s CEO, Richard Hatchett, shares Fauci’s basic timeline vision—a COVID-19 vaccine ready for early phases of safety testing in April. If all goes well, by late summer testing could begin to see if the vaccine actually prevents disease.</p>
<p>Overall, if all pieces fell into place, Hatchett guesses it would be 12 to 18 months before an initial product could be deemed safe and effective. That timeline represents “a vast acceleration compared with the history of vaccine development,” he told me. But it’s also unprecedentedly ambitious. “Even to propose such a timeline at this point must be regarded as hugely aspirational,” he added.</p>
<p>Even if that idyllic year-long projection were realized, the novel product would still require manufacturing and distribution. “An important consideration is whether the underlying approach can then be scaled to produce millions or even billions of doses in coming years,” Hatchett said. Especially in an ongoing emergency, if borders closed and supply chains broke, distribution and production could prove difficult purely as a matter of logistics.</p>
<p>Fauci’s initial optimism seemed to wane, too. Last week he said that the process of vaccine development was proving “very difficult and very frustrating.” For all the advances in basic science, the process cannot proceed to an actual vaccine without extensive clinical testing, which requires manufacturing many vaccines and meticulously monitoring outcomes in people. The process could ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars—money that the NIH, start-ups, and universities don’t have. Nor do they have the production facilities and technology to mass-manufacture and distribute a vaccine.</p>
<p>Production of vaccines has long been contingent on investment from one of the handful of giant global pharmaceutical companies. At the Aspen Institute last week, Fauci lamented that none had yet to “step up” and commit to making the vaccine. “Companies that have the skill to be able to do it are not going to just sit around and have a warm facility, ready to go for when you need it,” he said. Even if they did, taking on a new product like this could mean massive losses, especially if the demand faded or if people, for complex reasons, chose not to use the product.</p>
<p>Making vaccines is so difficult, cost intensive, and high risk that in the 1980s, when drug companies began to incur legal costs over alleged harms caused by vaccines, many opted to simply quit making them. To incentivize the pharmaceutical industry to keep producing these vital products, the U.S. government offered to indemnify anyone claiming to have been harmed by a vaccine. The arrangement continues to this day. Even still, drug companies have generally found it more profitable to invest in the daily-use drugs for chronic conditions. And coronaviruses could present a particular challenge in that at their core they, like influenza viruses, contain single strands of RNA. This viral class is likely to mutate, and vaccines may need to be in constant development, as with the flu.</p>
<p>“If we’re putting all our hopes in a vaccine as being the answer, we’re in trouble,” Jason Schwartz, an assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health who studies vaccine policy, told me. The best-case scenario, as Schwartz sees it, is the one in which this vaccine development happens far too late to make a difference for the current outbreak. The real problem is that preparedness for this outbreak should have been happening for the past decade, ever since SARS. “Had we not set the SARS-vaccine-research program aside, we would have had a lot more of this foundational work that we could apply to this new, closely related virus, ” he said. But, as with Ebola, government funding and pharmaceutical-industry development evaporated once the sense of emergency lifted. “Some very early research ended up sitting on a shelf because that outbreak ended before a vaccine needed to be aggressively developed.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Politico reported that the White House is preparing to ask Congress for $1 billion in emergency funding for a coronavirus response. This request, if it materialized, would come in the same month in which President Donald Trump released a new budget proposal that would cut key elements of pandemic preparedness—funding for the CDC, the NIH, and foreign aid.  </p>
<p>These long-term government investments matter because creating vaccines, antiviral medications, and other vital tools requires decades of serious investment, even when demand is low. Market-based economies often struggle to develop a product for which there is no immediate demand and to distribute products to the places they’re needed. CEPI has been touted as a promising model to incentivize vaccine development before an emergency begins, but the group also has skeptics. Last year, Doctors Without Borders wrote a scathing open letter, saying the model didn’t ensure equitable distribution or affordability. CEPI subsequently updated its policies to forefront equitable access, and Manuel Martin, a medical innovation and access adviser with Doctors Without Borders, told me last week that he’s now cautiously optimistic. “CEPI is absolutely promising, and we really hope that it will be successful in producing a novel vaccine,” he said. But he and his colleagues are “waiting to see how CEPI’s commitments play out in practice.”</p>
<p>These considerations matter not simply as humanitarian benevolence, but also as effective policy. Getting vaccines and other resources to the places where they will be most helpful is essential to stop disease from spreading widely. During the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak, for example, Mexico was hit hard. In Australia, which was not, the government prevented exports by its pharmaceutical industry until it filled the Australian government’s order for vaccines. The more the world enters lockdown and self-preservation mode, the more difficult it could be to soberly assess risk and effectively distribute tools, from vaccines and respirator masks to food and hand soap.</p>
<p>Italy, Iran, and South Korea are now among the countries reporting quickly growing numbers of detected COVID-19 infections. Many countries have responded with containment attempts, despite the dubious efficacy and inherent harms of China’s historically unprecedented crackdown. Certain containment measures will be appropriate, but widely banning travel, closing down cities, and hoarding resources are not realistic solutions for an outbreak that lasts years. All of these measures come with risks of their own. Ultimately some pandemic responses will require opening borders, not closing them. At some point the expectation that any area will escape effects of COVID-19 must be abandoned: The disease must be seen as everyone’s problem.  </p>
