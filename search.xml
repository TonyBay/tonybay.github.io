<p>28日，发现有网民在新浪微博发布我街道某社区发生肢体冲突的视频后，第一时间予以核实处置。现将情况说明如下：</p>
<p>28日，我街综合执法与物业公司联合清理彰武楼小区堆放杂物时，物业公司人员与视频中的老人发生肢体冲突，后社区负责人现场协调，物业公司与该工作人员向老人道歉，并得到老人谅解。我街已对物业公司负责人进行了约谈，责成严肃处理该工作人员。</p>
<p>据了解，视频反映地点长期、反复堆放废品，物业公司曾多次进行现金回购，但周围群众仍反映存在火灾隐患，视频当事老人也表示废品自行变卖，不再进行集中堆放，大家共同为居民营造良好</p>

<p>跟大家说一下今天上午的进展，上午我们一共有三个人进入了小区，一个朋友在外面，找到住址的时候，视频中的张大爷正好出去收废品去了，期间我们与物业管理人员聊了聊，张大爷回来后到他家里和他及其家人聊了很久，大致情况如下：1、张大爷：年轻的时候应该是在类似废品分拣处理的地方工作，因此具有废物回收的意识，可以说是有爱好也有技术基础，由于废品不能及时出货，多数时候堆放在自己一楼的窗下，也因此多与物业发生矛盾，大爷几年前腿摔伤过，留了钢钉，走路有些跛，大爷有残疾人证明，领低保，过节社区也会发一些东西照顾；2、家庭：张大爷与哥哥嫂子生活在一起，已经有18年了，能看出哥嫂真的把他当做家里人；3、打人者：据说好像姓李，物业人员，小区物业人员经常来清理张大爷的废品，毕竟存在安全卫生隐患，多数人比较客气，有时还会出钱回收废品，只有这个李某来了就骂人，很难听，家属都不愿意搭理他，这部分是家属反映的不是物业说的，具物业负责人反映，这个打人者昨天已经被辞退；4、起因：由于疫情，这次的清理工作更深入，要没收三轮车，张大爷去阻拦，发生了视频中的暴力行为，当时嫂子在屋内并不知情（应该是习惯了清理，没有特别注意），后来看了对面楼的视频才知道这次这么严重；5、伤情：大爷说昨天一晚上没睡，不过看着精神状态很好，早上又去工作了，我们询问是否需要去医院，家属表示不用；6、捐款：在我们再三表示全国人民的关心和捐款意愿后，哥嫂仍说不需要并感谢大家的关心，我们表示如果不需要钱，我们捐一些口罩酒精等防护用品，哥嫂还是不需要，这个我随后再想办法；7、警方：由于我们是非小区人员进入小区，社区负责人报了警，警方在我们离开时正好赶到，了解情况后他们表示这个事情还在处理中，会给一个结果。<br>事情经过大概是这样，这个家庭就是我们天津普普通通的老百姓，张大爷与家人生活在一起可以说有生活保障，我个人觉得每一种生活方式都值得被尊重，希望警方可以给施暴者以严惩！</p>

<p>没有调查就没有发言权，所以，我亲自跑到彰武楼调查了一番。</p>
<p>这个地方就在本溪路地铁站，离我家饭店不远，我吃完饭坐上公交直接就过去了。</p>
<p>进入社区之后，还不是很好找，彰武楼小区很大，找了十来分钟才找到，通过反复比对，确认自己的确找到了。</p>
<p>我拍照的时候，有一个穿着粉色大衣的大姐路过，问我是干什么的，我说我也是天津人，住得离这儿不远，也有亲戚住这儿，知道这件事到这儿来看看，了解一下情况。</p>
<p>我问她：“怎么，您是咱社区工作人员吗？”</p>
<p>粉色大衣的姐姐说：“是的，我是居委会的，您是记者还是？”</p>
<p>“我不是记者，算是一个热心市民吧，我是天津的一个大v，之所以过来，是因为网上能看到的仅仅有一个视频片段，这个事情的前因后果都不清楚的情况下，很多网民就开始骂街，骂个人也就算了，很多人直接指着天津市鼻子骂，作为天津人我觉得很耻辱，所以我想亲自过来，了解一下情况，挨骂也得明明白白的挨骂，不能什么事都不知道就挨骂。”</p>
<p>大姐了解了我的来意，开始和我讲事情的前因后果，讲得差不多的时候，正好开过来一辆车，车上的人看到我和居委会的人聊天，开车窗问怎么回事，我亮明身份讲清来意之后，车上的人也下来了，他是物业经理，是那几个保安的顶头上司。</p>
<p>物业经理又从头到尾把这件事和我说了一遍，说的和居委会那位女同志是一样的，不存在串通，也不存在事先沟通和准备，都是站一块话赶话聊出来的。</p>
<p>这是他们两个人，和物业经理的车，为了保护人家的隐私权，没有拍脸和车牌号，仅仅为证明我的确去了，也的确他们沟通过的事实。</p>
<p>这两个人和我叙述的时候是分别叙述的，并没有串通什么的，两个人说的基本一致。有人说我造假，衣服明明灰的你却说是粉的，这么说的人一点脑子没有，这衣服看上去真的是粉的，不知道为什么一拍是灰的，我要真造假还能颜色都对不上？服气了也是。</p>
<p>接下来，我给大家原封不动的叙述一遍，还原一下事情经过。</p>
<p>这个拾荒老人叫老四，说是老人，其实不老，今年57岁，在彰武楼拾荒已经有很长时间了，和物业居委会的都很熟，并不是不认识的关系。</p>
<p>物业经理给我指了前方这片空地，说：“现在的样子是收拾完的样子，都是我们给收拾的，之前他用一大片铁丝网，把这块公共空地圈起来一大片，里面堆满了他四处捡来的垃圾，味道很难闻，一到夏天苍蝇蚊子一大堆，而且有很多纸夹子，明确属于消防安全隐患，前后楼的居民已经反映过他很多次了。”</p>
<p>尤其前段时间，是全国创文创卫期间，基层工作人员忙的不行，天天盯卫生，从当官的到公务员都出去满大街捡烟头，在这种情况下，他收集的这些垃圾就更给政府部门的工作拖后腿了。</p>
<p>于是，物业和居委会和他商量过很多次，不要再收垃圾了，他捡来的垃圾能卖十块二十块的，他们出价三五十收走，弄来一辆破三轮，一百块钱，他们三百收，之所以高价收，就是希望他不要再这么干了。</p>
<p>但是没有用，他还是屡次三番，不顾居民的反映，不顾街道物业的劝说，一次次的重操旧业，继续捡垃圾，连他自己的哥哥嫂子都劝过他很多次，他也不听。</p>
<p>老四并不是没有收入，他是街道的帮扶对象，一个人领着好几份钱，再过3年，60岁一退休，他还能领到一笔退休金，生活上完全不存在问题，在这种情况下，街道还经常给他送米送面送油，可以说是对他很好了。这个人也并不是你们所想的什么homeless，他的哥哥嫂子也住在这儿，天天照顾他，跟亲爹妈也差不多，生活上并不存在问题。</p>
<p>咱们国家搞得最好的就是精准扶贫，彰武楼小区在出这件事之前，在评比中拿了天津市第一还是红桥区第一记不清了，是一个基层工作做得其实还很好的社区。</p>
<p>什么流离失所衣食无着，不存在的。</p>
<p>其他的可能还存疑，关于帮扶这块绝对是真的，精准扶贫啊！这是发生在我身边的实实在在的事，我们附近不远就有公租房，很多人住着免费的公租房（有和租房价格相匹配的补贴），拿着各种各样的补贴，街道还经常送温暖给菜给肉给米面油，现在我遇到的老人没有骂共产党的，最不济的也会说一句“共产党这就算不错，相当好了”。</p>
<p>这个是绝对不能黑的。</p>
<p>那么，这次的事是怎么回事呢？</p>
<p>之前讲到，创文创卫期间，街道和居委会屡次劝说，他还是屡次收垃圾，现在到了疫情期间，他还是四处收垃圾，那么脏的垃圾，四处摆放，万一传播了新冠后果不堪设想，街道和居委会找他严肃的谈，别扒垃圾箱了，他还是不听，还是继续的收。</p>
<p>街道居委会说，你非得给大家添乱，再这样，我们就要强行收缴你的废品了，他也不听，照收不误。</p>
<p>然后我说：“这些情况我都知道，但是再怎么样，也不应该动手啊，干嘛还把他撂地下啊，还拖着走，控制住就得了啊。”</p>
<p>物业经理说：“好么，他手里有钉子你知道吗？“</p>
<p>“我们去收缴的时候，他手里拿着钉子，执法人员没办法了，也的确被他的行为激怒了，才动的手。”</p>
<p>事发之后，物业经理得知有人动手了，问清前因后果之后，虽然说是事出有因，还是第一时间就把那个保安给辞了。</p>
<p>当天晚上，物业找到了老四了解情况，得知老四也没有受伤，保安第一时间也辞了，东西也收缴完毕了，又再三劝说老四别再收了，老四也答应了，这件事其实就过去了。</p>
<p>然后就不知道被谁捅到网上了，今天早晨红桥区里的也给彰武楼党群服务中心打了电话，人民日报也来电话了。这些人跟我反馈的时候也觉得很冤枉，这一件事被拍下来就这样了，我们之前做了那么多好事，这么帮扶他，怎么没人说呢？</p>
<p>当然，既然是问话，我也不敢说保证百分之百的真实，但是我不傻，他们说这些话的时候，全都不假思索，侃侃而谈，编瞎话没有这样的，而且人家又都是公职人员，在我明确表示了会发到网上被大量网友看到的情况下，他们依然该说什么说什么，无论怎么看，我都觉得这不会是什么谎话。</p>
<p>至于那个红旗，我拍下来了，不得不说网友眼是真尖，还的确是个国旗。</p>
<p>关于这个国旗的事，居委会和物业其实也跟他说过，“国旗都得挂起来，挂在干净的地方，你这国旗插在你废品车上，周围都是废品，这么脏，这样算怎么回事啊”，他也不听。</p>
<p>事情前因后果就是这样，我相信他们说的是真实的，一不存在事先沟通，事发的时候是半夜，我早晨去的，没有什么统一口径的时间；二来都是话赶话跟聊天一样说的，两个人前后说的完全一致，应该就是这么回事。老人的话在家，我不是记者没有采访权，但是人家既然敢让我发到网上，就不太可能是假话，谁敢这么干？</p>
<p>说来说去，无论怎么样，那个保安也不应该动手，这是居委会和物业经理都认同的，他们也第一时间采取了补救措施，安抚了被打的拾荒者，各级部门也第一时间前来过问，了解了前因后果，被打的人也的确没有伤，保安也都已经被辞了，上级部门也觉得不是什么大事，才草草发了这么一条简短的声明出来。</p>
<p>而且，现在新的结果出来了，打人的保安被拘留了十天，我就告诉你们这件事不可能这么就完了，听信，你们总是没耐心。</p>
<p>但是，广大网友并不了解这里面的前因后果，他们只看到这样一个视频，一瞬间什么言论都出来了。</p>
<p>“无家可归者被保安欺负”。</p>
<p>“挖掘机是人，卡车是人，只有人不是人”。</p>
<p>“这个社会，老百姓一丁点尊严都没有“。</p>
<p>“老爷子一定是个很爱护国旗，我都能想象他把国旗擦得干干净净，珍而重之插在车上的样子”。</p>
<p>等等这些言论，都出来了，还拿了不少赞同。</p>
<p>光看这一个视频，的确是太容易得出这样的结论了，我也理解你们的义愤填膺，因为一开始的我也是气的不行，这个事件太容易让网友发泄情绪了，但是了解下来，事情根本不是网友们想象的那样。</p>
<p>而且，用国旗上纲上线，太严重了吧？内心戏是不是太多了点？</p>
<p>天津人也并不是你们说的那么恶。在天津， 一味蛮横无理的人是绝对不得人心的，天津人办事非常讲究一个“分寸”，一个“面子”，一上来就打人，这种事情在天津别说没有，发生的太少太少了，上来直接动手，这根本不符合天津人的办事特点。</p>
<p>一个听相声长大的城市，一个发大水满城人跑到大街上玩水，小小子背着小闺女上街逮鱼的城市，一个人人都会说相声，满大街段子手的城市，我不说，你们自己想想，会是你们口中的恶霸城市吗？</p>
<p>我是太了解天津人的性格了，所以我才觉得事情可能没有那么简单，才决定亲自跑去现场一探究竟，打人无论如何都是不对的，但毕竟还是事出有因。</p>
<p>以上就是事件的全部经过，我已经加了物业经理和居委会工作人员的微信，大家有什么想了解的，还可以继续问我，我还可以再去调查和了解。</p>
<p>作为一个天津人，讲几句公道话，天津在这次疫情中方方面面都做得很好，大家有目共睹，我也不希望自己的家乡被看作是欺压弱小的恶棍城市。</p>
<p>平心而论，老爷子里外里两千多，虽然说逢年过节有点福利，但稍微大点手真的不够花，他想多挣点钱，有错吗？也只能捡点废品。基层人员天天出去捡烟头容易吗？也不容易，但无论如何也不应该打人，但是他也有他的难处，众生皆苦，该抨击的我们要抨击，但是也要看到每个人都不容易，唉，人活着，可不就是这样么。</p>
<p>天津人平时讲究乐乐呵呵，根本也不是那么强凶霸道，这件事归根结底有错没有，有的，但请大家理解毕竟是事出有因。也希望大家不要把错误归咎到全部天津人头上，天津人真不都是这样，希望大家还是能嘴下留情，感谢你们！</p>
<p>其实，细想想，这位叔叔到手两千多，想多挣点钱，有错吗？没有。基层工作人员每天出去捡烟头，那么辛苦，工作性质决定一定要管他，有错吗？也没错。打人必须被抨击，这没错，但我同时看到了众生皆苦，每个人都在自己的命运里拼命的往上爬，多一点宽容和理解吧，因为不光是他们，我们自己，也不容易。</p>
<p>唉。</p>
<p>最后，我也欢迎大家把这篇答案截图转发到微博等其他平台，让大家都了解一下事情的另一面，不同的声音，是怎样的。</p>
<p>以上。</p>
<p>————————————————————————</p>
<p>PS：有人在评论里说我是收了钱洗白的，在此我对天发誓，我如果真的是收钱写文，哪怕一分钱，我全家出事故横死，我求老天爷帮我应验这个毒誓。</p>
<p>喷我的人，你们如果要喷我，最好跟我一样发一个毒誓，“答主如果没收钱我全家也横死”，要玩跟我这么玩。</p>
<p>还有人怀疑“怎么这么巧，你一去就都来了”，对此我也照样发毒誓，如果我说瞎话照样全家死，如果按照你们的逻辑，这个世界上就没有巧事了。</p>
<p>我玩知乎以来从没编过故事，我敢对自己说的每句话负责，我的人品，不是随便哪个过来就能质疑的。</p>
<p>另外，我找不到老人在哪，我也不是记者也不是什么公司机构，仅仅代表我个人是很难采访路人和老人的，一开始你们能看到的只有视频，我负责把物业和居委会的话传过来，老人那边其他的人在采访，你们不妨两边都听着，我所做的是尽自己一份力量去还原全貌，并没有主观臆断的下定论。</p>
<p>以上。</p>

    <title>You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="You’re-Likely-to-Get-the-Coronavirus"><a href="#You’re-Likely-to-Get-the-Coronavirus" class="headerlink" title="You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus"></a>You’re Likely to Get the Coronavirus</h1><p><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/02/covid-vaccine/607000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Atlantic</a>   <strong>JAMES HAMBLIN</strong>   <em>2020-2-24</em>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most cases are not life-threatening, which is also what makes the virus a historic challenge to contain.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>In May 1997, a 3-year-old boy developed what at first seemed like the common cold. When his symptoms—sore throat, fever, and cough—persisted for six days, he was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Hong Kong. There his cough worsened, and he began gasping for air. Despite intensive care, the boy died.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Puzzled by his rapid deterioration, doctors sent a sample of the boy’s sputum to China’s Department of Health. But the standard testing protocol couldn’t fully identify the virus that had caused the disease. The chief virologist decided to ship some of the sample to colleagues in other countries.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the boy’s sputum sat for a month, waiting for its turn in a slow process of antibody-matching analysis. The results eventually confirmed that this was a variant of influenza, the virus that has killed more people than any in history. But this type had never before been seen in humans. It was H5N1, or “avian flu,” discovered two decades prior, but known only to infect birds.</p>
<p>By then, it was August. Scientists sent distress signals around the world. The Chinese government swiftly killed 1.5 million chickens (over the protests of chicken farmers). Further cases were closely monitored and isolated. By the end of the year there were 18 known cases in humans. Six people died.</p>
<p>This was seen as a successful global response, and the virus was not seen again for years. In part, containment was possible because the disease was so severe: Those who got it became manifestly, extremely ill. H5N1 has a fatality rate of about 60 percent—if you get it, you’re likely to die. Yet since 2003, the virus has killed only 455 people. The much “milder” flu viruses, by contrast, kill fewer than 0.1 percent of people they infect, on average, but are responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths every year.</p>
<p>Severe illness caused by viruses such as H5N1 also means that infected people can be identified and isolated, or that they died quickly. They do not walk around feeling just a little under the weather, seeding the virus. The new coronavirus (known technically as SARS-CoV-2) that has been spreading around the world can cause a respiratory illness that can be severe. The disease (known as COVID-19) seems to have a fatality rate of less than 2 percent—exponentially lower than most outbreaks that make global news. The virus has raised alarm not despite that low fatality rate, but because of it.</p>
<p>Coronaviruses are similar to influenza viruses in that they both contain single strands of RNA.* Four coronaviruses commonly infect humans, causing colds. These are believed to have evolved in humans to maximize their own spread—which means sickening, but not killing, people. By contrast, the two prior novel coronavirus outbreaks—SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome, named for where the first outbreak occurred)—were picked up from animals, as was H5N1. These diseases were highly fatal to humans. If there were mild or asymptomatic cases, they were extremely few. Had there been more of them, the disease would have spread widely. Ultimately, SARS and MERS each killed fewer than 1,000 people.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is already reported to have killed more than twice that number. With its potent mix of characteristics, this virus is unlike most that capture popular attention: It is deadly, but not too deadly. It makes people sick, but not in predictable, uniquely identifiable ways. Last week, 14 Americans tested positive on a cruise ship in Japan despite feeling fine—the new virus may be most dangerous because, it seems, it may sometimes cause no symptoms at all.</p>
<p>The world has responded with unprecedented speed and mobilization of resources. The new virus was identified extremely quickly. Its genome was sequenced by Chinese scientists and shared around the world within weeks. The global scientific community has shared genomic and clinical data at unprecedented rates. Work on a vaccine is well under way. The Chinese government enacted dramatic containment measures, and the World Health Organization declared an emergency of international concern. All of this happened in a fraction of the time it took to even identify H5N1 in 1997. And yet the outbreak continues to spread.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Harvard epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch is exacting in his diction, even for an epidemiologist. Twice in our conversation he started to say something, then paused and said, “Actually, let me start again.” So it’s striking when one of the points he wanted to get exactly right was this: “I think the likely outcome is that it will ultimately not be containable.”</p>
<p>Containment is the first step in responding to any outbreak. In the case of COVID-19, the possibility (however implausible) of preventing a pandemic seemed to play out in a matter of days. Starting in January, China began cordoning off progressively larger areas, radiating outward from the city of Wuhan and eventually encapsulating some 100 million people. People were barred from leaving home, and lectured by drones if they were caught outside. Nonetheless, the virus has now been found in 24 countries.</p>
<p>Despite the apparent ineffectiveness of such measures—relative to their inordinate social and economic cost, at least—the crackdown continues to escalate. Under political pressure to “stop” the virus, last Thursday the Chinese government announced that officials in Hubei province would be going door-to-door, testing people for fevers and looking for signs of illness, then sending all potential cases to quarantine camps. But even with the ideal containment, the virus’s spread may have been inevitable. Testing people who are already extremely sick is an imperfect strategy if people can spread the virus without even feeling bad enough to stay home from work.</p>
<p>Lipsitch predicts that within the coming year, some 40 to 70 percent of people around the world will be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19. But, he clarifies emphatically, this does not mean that all will have severe illnesses. “It’s likely that many will have mild disease, or may be asymptomatic,” he said. As with influenza, which is often life-threatening to people with chronic health conditions and of older age, most cases pass without medical care. (Overall, about 14 percent of people with influenza have no symptoms.)</p>
<p>Lipsitch is far from alone in his belief that this virus will continue to spread widely. The emerging consensus among epidemiologists is that the most likely outcome of this outbreak is a new seasonal disease—a fifth “endemic” coronavirus. With the other four, people are not known to develop long-lasting immunity. If this one follows suit, and if the disease continues to be as severe as it is now, “cold and flu season” could become “cold and flu and COVID-19 season.”</p>
<p>At this point, it is not even known how many people are infected. As of Sunday, there have been 35 confirmed cases in the U.S., according to the World Health Organization. But Lipsitch’s “very, very rough” estimate when we spoke a week ago (banking on “multiple assumptions piled on top of each other,” he said) was that 100 or 200 people in the U.S. were infected. That’s all it would take to seed the disease widely. The rate of spread would depend on how contagious the disease is in milder cases. On Friday, Chinese scientists reported in the medical journal JAMA an apparent case of asymptomatic spread of the virus, from a patient with a normal chest CT scan. The researchers concluded with stolid understatement that if this finding is not a bizarre abnormality, “the prevention of COVID-19 infection would prove challenging.”</p>
<p>Even if Lipsitch’s estimates were off by orders of magnitude, they wouldn’t likely change the overall prognosis. “Two hundred cases of a flu-like illness during flu season—when you’re not testing for it—is very hard to detect,” Lipsitch said. “But it would be really good to know sooner rather than later whether that’s correct, or whether we’ve miscalculated something. The only way to do that is by testing.”</p>
<p>Originally, doctors in the U.S. were advised not to test people unless they had been to China or had contact with someone who had been diagnosed with the disease. Within the past two weeks, the CDC said it would start screening people in five U.S. cities, in an effort to give some idea of how many cases are actually out there. But tests are still not widely available. As of Friday, the Association of Public Health Laboratories said that only California, Nebraska, and Illinois had the capacity to test people for the virus.</p>
<p>With so little data, prognosis is difficult. But the concern that this virus is beyond containment—that it will be with us indefinitely—is nowhere more apparent than in the global race to find a vaccine, one of the clearest strategies for saving lives in the years to come.</p>
<hr>
<p>Over the past month, stock prices of a small pharmaceutical company named Inovio have more than doubled. In mid-January, it reportedly discovered a vaccine for the new coronavirus. This claim has been repeated in many news reports, even though it is technically inaccurate. Like other drugs, vaccines require a long testing process to see whether they indeed protect people from disease, and do so safely. What this company—and others—has done is copy a bit of the virus’s RNA that one day could prove to work as a vaccine. It’s a promising first step, but to call it a discovery is like announcing a new surgery after sharpening a scalpel.</p>
<p>Though genetic sequencing is now extremely fast, making vaccines is as much art as science. It involves finding a viral sequence that will reliably cause a protective immune-system memory but not trigger an acute inflammatory response that would itself cause symptoms. (While the influenza vaccine cannot cause the flu, the CDC warns that it can cause “flu-like symptoms.”) Hitting this sweet spot requires testing, first in lab models and animals, and eventually in people. One does not simply ship a billion viral gene fragments around the world to be injected into everyone at the moment of discovery.</p>
<p>Inovio is far from the only small biotech company venturing to create a sequence that strikes that balance. Others include Moderna, CureVac, and Novavax. Academic researchers are also on the case, at Imperial College London and other universities, as are federal scientists in several countries, including at the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Anthony Fauci, the head of the NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, wrote in JAMA in January that the agency was working at historic speed to find a vaccine. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, researchers moved from obtaining the genomic sequence of the virus and into a phase 1 clinical trial of a vaccine in 20 months. Fauci wrote that his team has since compressed that timeline to just over three months for other viruses, and for the new coronavirus, “they hope to move even faster.”</p>
<p>New models have sprung up in recent years, too, that promise to speed up vaccine development. One is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), which was launched in Norway in 2017 to finance and coordinate the development of new vaccines. Its founders include the governments of Norway and India, the Wellcome Trust, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The group’s money is now flowing to Inovio and other small biotech start-ups, encouraging them to get into the risky business of vaccine development. The group’s CEO, Richard Hatchett, shares Fauci’s basic timeline vision—a COVID-19 vaccine ready for early phases of safety testing in April. If all goes well, by late summer testing could begin to see if the vaccine actually prevents disease.</p>
<p>Overall, if all pieces fell into place, Hatchett guesses it would be 12 to 18 months before an initial product could be deemed safe and effective. That timeline represents “a vast acceleration compared with the history of vaccine development,” he told me. But it’s also unprecedentedly ambitious. “Even to propose such a timeline at this point must be regarded as hugely aspirational,” he added.</p>
<p>Even if that idyllic year-long projection were realized, the novel product would still require manufacturing and distribution. “An important consideration is whether the underlying approach can then be scaled to produce millions or even billions of doses in coming years,” Hatchett said. Especially in an ongoing emergency, if borders closed and supply chains broke, distribution and production could prove difficult purely as a matter of logistics.</p>
<p>Fauci’s initial optimism seemed to wane, too. Last week he said that the process of vaccine development was proving “very difficult and very frustrating.” For all the advances in basic science, the process cannot proceed to an actual vaccine without extensive clinical testing, which requires manufacturing many vaccines and meticulously monitoring outcomes in people. The process could ultimately cost hundreds of millions of dollars—money that the NIH, start-ups, and universities don’t have. Nor do they have the production facilities and technology to mass-manufacture and distribute a vaccine.</p>
<p>Production of vaccines has long been contingent on investment from one of the handful of giant global pharmaceutical companies. At the Aspen Institute last week, Fauci lamented that none had yet to “step up” and commit to making the vaccine. “Companies that have the skill to be able to do it are not going to just sit around and have a warm facility, ready to go for when you need it,” he said. Even if they did, taking on a new product like this could mean massive losses, especially if the demand faded or if people, for complex reasons, chose not to use the product.</p>
<p>Making vaccines is so difficult, cost intensive, and high risk that in the 1980s, when drug companies began to incur legal costs over alleged harms caused by vaccines, many opted to simply quit making them. To incentivize the pharmaceutical industry to keep producing these vital products, the U.S. government offered to indemnify anyone claiming to have been harmed by a vaccine. The arrangement continues to this day. Even still, drug companies have generally found it more profitable to invest in the daily-use drugs for chronic conditions. And coronaviruses could present a particular challenge in that at their core they, like influenza viruses, contain single strands of RNA. This viral class is likely to mutate, and vaccines may need to be in constant development, as with the flu.</p>
<p>“If we’re putting all our hopes in a vaccine as being the answer, we’re in trouble,” Jason Schwartz, an assistant professor at Yale School of Public Health who studies vaccine policy, told me. The best-case scenario, as Schwartz sees it, is the one in which this vaccine development happens far too late to make a difference for the current outbreak. The real problem is that preparedness for this outbreak should have been happening for the past decade, ever since SARS. “Had we not set the SARS-vaccine-research program aside, we would have had a lot more of this foundational work that we could apply to this new, closely related virus, ” he said. But, as with Ebola, government funding and pharmaceutical-industry development evaporated once the sense of emergency lifted. “Some very early research ended up sitting on a shelf because that outbreak ended before a vaccine needed to be aggressively developed.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, Politico reported that the White House is preparing to ask Congress for $1 billion in emergency funding for a coronavirus response. This request, if it materialized, would come in the same month in which President Donald Trump released a new budget proposal that would cut key elements of pandemic preparedness—funding for the CDC, the NIH, and foreign aid.  </p>
<p>These long-term government investments matter because creating vaccines, antiviral medications, and other vital tools requires decades of serious investment, even when demand is low. Market-based economies often struggle to develop a product for which there is no immediate demand and to distribute products to the places they’re needed. CEPI has been touted as a promising model to incentivize vaccine development before an emergency begins, but the group also has skeptics. Last year, Doctors Without Borders wrote a scathing open letter, saying the model didn’t ensure equitable distribution or affordability. CEPI subsequently updated its policies to forefront equitable access, and Manuel Martin, a medical innovation and access adviser with Doctors Without Borders, told me last week that he’s now cautiously optimistic. “CEPI is absolutely promising, and we really hope that it will be successful in producing a novel vaccine,” he said. But he and his colleagues are “waiting to see how CEPI’s commitments play out in practice.”</p>
<p>These considerations matter not simply as humanitarian benevolence, but also as effective policy. Getting vaccines and other resources to the places where they will be most helpful is essential to stop disease from spreading widely. During the 2009 H1N1 flu outbreak, for example, Mexico was hit hard. In Australia, which was not, the government prevented exports by its pharmaceutical industry until it filled the Australian government’s order for vaccines. The more the world enters lockdown and self-preservation mode, the more difficult it could be to soberly assess risk and effectively distribute tools, from vaccines and respirator masks to food and hand soap.</p>
<p>Italy, Iran, and South Korea are now among the countries reporting quickly growing numbers of detected COVID-19 infections. Many countries have responded with containment attempts, despite the dubious efficacy and inherent harms of China’s historically unprecedented crackdown. Certain containment measures will be appropriate, but widely banning travel, closing down cities, and hoarding resources are not realistic solutions for an outbreak that lasts years. All of these measures come with risks of their own. Ultimately some pandemic responses will require opening borders, not closing them. At some point the expectation that any area will escape effects of COVID-19 must be abandoned: The disease must be seen as everyone’s problem.  </p>
